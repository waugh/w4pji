Static web site: Women for Peace and Justice in Iran http://women4peace.org/

Purpose
-------

This source code embodies the content for the web site and wraps the content in
a more or less uniform layout and style.

Technical Approach
------------------

This uses the Ruby programming language to wrap the content in the layouts.

To Build
--------

Install whatever Ruby interpreter is identified in src/.ruby-version . You can
use "rbenv" or similar tool to do that.

Change directories to "src" and run the Unix "make" utility.

That should build the web site in ../public . You can copy that to the web host.
