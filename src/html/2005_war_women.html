<p><i>Peace to the world<br/>
Peace to my country, my love<br/>
Peace to your dreams<br/>
Peace to your children</i> (1)</p>

<p><span>These are the words of a lullaby that Iraqi women
sing to their children. Like all mothers around the world, they dream of peace.
The </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-family:Arial'>United
  States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style='font-family:Arial'>
government, the &quot;great savior&quot; of the women of the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial'>Middle East</span></st1:place><span>, brings them war.</span></p>

<p><span>With the First World War and increasingly afterwards,
the majority of the victims of war have been civilians, especially women, who
are less mobile than men since they are the caretakers of children and the
old.&nbsp; With the arrival of the soldiers and unraveling of the community
ties, women are raped and forced into sexual slavery by their own armies and
the armies of the conquerors. From the Old Testament where &quot;women are
raped in Zion; virgins in the towns of Judah&quot; (2), to General Hooker's
women in the American Civil War(3), to the Japanese's sexual enslavement of
Chinese, Korean and Japanese peasant girls known as Comfort Women (4), the rape
of women as a weapon of war has been a reality in this world. With rape and
prostitution, war extends its destruction of everything to the body and
integrity of women. (5)</span></p>

<p><span>The repercussions of war for women continue long
after the end of any war.&nbsp; Women become victims of the aftermath of war
due to the destruction of the infrastructure of family and community, increase
in poverty, prostitution and other ills. In addition, during any war, the
democratic civil movements such as women's movements are controlled and
subjected to the patriotic demand, &quot;The defense of the fatherland&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span>In this increasingly militarized system of global
capital, the issue of women's rights must be considered in the framework of
war.&nbsp; Women's rights are human rights, and human rights deteriorate with
the atrocities of war. But, there is a tendency to treat women and their rights
as a special case.&nbsp;&nbsp; This marginalization becomes more evident when
the topic is the rights of women in the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial'>Middle East</span></st1:place><span> or &quot;Moslem countries&quot;. It is in this
context that the ugly and illogical concept of liberation of women through war
gains currency.</span></p>

<p><span>In 2002, after the devastating </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> war against the Afghani people, Bush proclaims
&quot;Respect for women... can triumph in the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial'>Middle East</span></st1:place><span> and beyond!&quot; According to the </span><st1:State><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Post</i> (5),
&quot;Reported cases of sexual assault in the military increased.&nbsp; 1700
are processed in 2004.&quot;&nbsp; Maybe Mr. Bush should concern himself with
providing respect for the American women!&nbsp; Bush's statement and many more
like it pronounced by his wife and others in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> are an insult to the women and people of the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial'>Middle East</span></st1:place><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>What is more disturbing is that activists in the
peace and justice movement often bring up the issue of women's rights in the
context of debates on US imperialist wars in the Middle East. They ask
&quot;But, <span class=GramE>is</span> it not true that women in those
countries have no rights?&quot; The answer is &quot;no&quot;. There is no
country in the world where women have equal rights with men. In the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> there is a backlash against women's rights but no
one is talking about invading the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. Women of various countries have achieved different
degrees of rights based on their necessities and historical development.&nbsp;
As an example, while some pharmacists in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> have refused to fill certain birth control pills, in
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-family:Arial'>Iran</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, the family planning policy includes the accessibility
of birth control pills everywhere at subsidized prices.&nbsp; In fact, five
years ago, </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-family:Arial'>Iran</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>'s family planning program was considered one of the
best in the world by the UN.</span></p>

<p><span>While the women in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Afghanistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> have worn their <span class=SpellE>burkas</span> for
150 years, American feminists never talked about the <span class=SpellE>burka</span>-clad
women in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-family:Arial'>Afghanistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> until the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> government made those women the poster child of its
war propaganda.&nbsp; In fact, a section of the American Left, among them the <span
class=htmltypewriter2><i><span style='font-family:Arial;color:black'>Nation</span></i></span>
Magazine, supported the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> war in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Afghanistan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>. And some feminist publications celebrated the
&quot;liberation&quot; of the Afghan women under </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> occupation. Meanwhile the Revolutionary Association
of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) has reported the increase in poverty,
prostitution and misery of women as a result of the war and its aftermath.</span></p>

<p><span>One of the most important aspects of human rights is
self determination for the individual, as well as for any society. The women in
the </span><st1:place><span style='font-family:Arial'>Middle East</span></st1:place><span>, whether secular or religious, whether Moslem,
Christian, Jewish, or of any other persuasion, have a long history of defining
and gaining their rights on their own terms.&nbsp; They have achieved this in
the face of obstacles from their own ruling classes and from the colonialists
and imperialists.&nbsp; The repression of all democratic movements in the </span><st1:place><span
 style='font-family:Arial'>Middle East</span></st1:place><span> by the imperialist countries has strongly impeded
the advance of women's rights.</span></p>

<p><span>In the case of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Iran</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, the 1953 CIA coup against the democratic movement
of the Iranian people resulted in 25 years of an autocratic monarchy, which was
overthrown by the 1979 revolution.&nbsp; The CIA built a security/intelligence
organization in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style='font-family:
  Arial'>Iran</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style='font-family:
Arial'> and trained the necessary experts in torture, as they are doing in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Iraq</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> today.&nbsp; During those 25 years every attempt of
the Iranian people for their rights was violently repressed.&nbsp; Distrust of
the West due to the interference of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> in the affairs of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Iran</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> contributed to the attraction of the traditional
Islamist's politics during the revolution.</span></p>

<p><span>This is the reason that to the well-meaning friends
who ask, &quot;But, what should we do?&quot; My answer is &quot;What do you
mean, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>we</i>?&quot;, since it is
extremely important for Americans to separate themselves from their imperialist
war mongering government. Then I say, &quot;First, do no harm&quot;.&nbsp; And
if you want to do something, do everything possible to stop the harm that your
government is doing in the Middle East, the harm whose most oppressed victims
are the women.</span></p>

<p><span>The Left Americans need to respect the people of the
rest of the world. The tendency to become concerned about a people when they
are on the agenda of the White House and State Department is very problematic.
Firstly, it stems from cultural imperialism. The other people in the world are
not on a mission to save the Americans. It is curious that the Americans consider
the saving of others their mission.&nbsp; They do behave as saviors, not as
friends who have answered a call for help. The one shining counterexample is
when the American people were successful to make their government join the rest
of humanity and boycott the apartheid government in South Africa.&nbsp; That
was a case where the ANC had set the agenda and asked the people of the world
to boycott the government. </span></p>

<p><span>Too often, however, American activists treat the
people of the Global South as children and set agendas for them. One example is
when the respected and radical Kate Millet went to Iran, right after the
revolution, to save the Iranian women, and then insulted the culture in her
book (7).&nbsp; Why would the Iranian women, who, despite years of imprisonment
and torture under the shah, had participated in the Iranian revolution, which
had defeated the US, need Ms. Millet as a savior? </span></p>

<p><span>This is not to deny international solidarity, but to
call on our American sisters and brothers who work so hard for peace and justice,
to think hard, remember the history of atrocities of their government against
the people, and step carefully.&nbsp; Many women of color and their
organizations, for years, have complained of cultural imperialism in the
feminist movement in the US.&nbsp; This issue is more critical today because
the American government and its neo-con ideologues are using the cry of women's
rights in their propaganda for war and are co-opting some of the feminist
organizations as well.</span></p>

<p><span>Another problem is that too often Bush and the
neo-cons set the framework of debate and the peace activists follow. I don't
believe the people in the peace and justice movement should be involved in the
discussion of how to be a better occupier, or about an exit strategy. We need
to completely subvert the prevailing paradigm, not only the paradigm that is
ruling the country, but also the paradigm that is ruling our peace and justice
movement.</span></p>

<p><span>An example of Bush setting the framework for debate
appears in the discussion of nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Many in the
movement use the analogy that the White House uses.&nbsp; Mr. Bush talks about
an &quot;axis of evil&quot; in which he groups Iran and North Korea
together.&nbsp; Since that speech, Iran and Korea are grouped together in many
leaflets and writings by the organizations and people on the Left. (8) This is
an example where the movement promotes Bush's propaganda.&nbsp; Before the use
of this analogy by Bush, there was nothing to link Korea and Iran. Iran is in
the Middle East, and Korea is not. Their governmental systems, people's
ancestry, language, religion, are all different.&nbsp; This linking is done in
discussions of nuclear proliferation despite the fact that Iran is a member of
the Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and is building an energy plant while Korea
has announced its withdrawal from the NPT and has announced that it is
developing nuclear weapons.</span></p>

<p><span>So if we want to defend the rights of women anywhere
in the world, including the USA, we have to work for peace, and against war, and
against the military, and that has to be the first order of things, and
absolutely the first order for the people of the occupying country.&nbsp;
Nothing else matters if you don't have a life, and your children die, and your
home is bombed, and your brothers are tortured by the occupiers. The only thing
that matters to the masses of women is an end to the carnage, an end to war and
occupation. So that without fear of the foreign soldiers they can emerge from
their homes, smell the fresh air and begin their lives again.</span></p>

<p><span>To conclude, support for women's rights is
inseparable from respect for their self determination, and unconditional
opposition to all Imperialist wars.</span></p>
