<p>Greetings, friends and comrades.</p>

<P>Today I am speaking to you as a member of a peace organization in Washington, 
the Coalition to Stop the US War against Iraq. This organization was formed in 
1991 in response to the beginning of the US war against the people of Iraq, and 
has worked on ending the sanctions and bringing peace to Iraq. I am an Iranian 
woman of Kurdish ancestry who has lived in the US for a long time, and the fact 
that I do work on peace for Iraq, I believe, carries a message that I am very 
interested in promoting; that is the message of solidarity. Though Saddam 
Hussein dropped chemical weapons on villages of Kurdistan, and carried on an 
eight-year US-supported war with Iran, causing the deaths of half a million 
people on both sides, I, as a Kurdish/Iranian woman, stand in solidarity with 
all the people of Iraq. The only way we can bring about peace and justice in the 
world, and specifically at this time in the Middle East, is with solidarity 
among all the people of the Middle East, especially the women. That is because 
according to all available statistics, women and children are the ones who 
suffer the most as the result of war, in the form of refugees, and in the form 
of widows trying to eke out a living for their children. In fact, an Afghani 
woman who recently visited Afghanistan, upon her return, was telling us how she 
learned that many widows of the war are prostituting themselves in the backs of 
some shops in Kabul to earn money to feed their children.</p>

<P>The Iranian women activists, like women activists from other Middle-East 
countries, have to walk a very tight rope. We have to work for peace and 
justice, which means that we must work against any kind of US imperialist 
interventions in our countries, while at the same time we continue to struggle 
for our rights against our own repressive governments. In the case of Iran, the 
theocratic government has constrained many of the rights of women. The women of 
Iran, for the last 23 years, both inside and outside of Iran, have consistently 
worked to gain their basic human rights.</p>

<P>It should be pointed out that the Iranian women inside Iran are very 
sophisticated. With their participation in the 1979 revolution, and their 
history of struggle against imperialism and for their rights since the beginning 
of the 20th Century, they are not some passive women under a cover. Today in 
Iran, despite tremendous impediments, women are active participants in their 
destiny. From running for city councils; to running for the presidency of the 
country; to participating in worker, student, environmental, welfare, and 
charity organizations; women in Iran raise the level of discourse to include 
demands for fundamental political change. Today in Iran, women applicants for 
college constitute more than 50% of all applicants. These women, in their 
everyday participation in politics, the arts, and publication of books and 
magazines on women's issues, are stretching the limits of the Islamic laws, and 
calling for more liberalization all the time. They are also active in many 
international issues, most recently in support of the Palestinian people.</p>

<P>The women from Iran in exile have been working for 22 years in defense of 
human rights, and specifically Iranian women's human rights, participating in 
international movements, international forums, working with Amnesty 
International, and in conferences on women; and bringing forth the voices of 
Iranian women, especially those promoting separation of religion and state and 
establishment of a secular society, which is very difficult to express in Iran.</p>

<P>Today, the propaganda attacks by the US government and the Zionists on Iran 
have given much impetus to the ultra-right faction of the ruling class in Iran 
to crack down on the people's pro-democracy advocacy and movement. Bush included 
Iran in his "Axis of Evil"; the US government has accused Iran of "harboring 
terrorists", and even of cooperating with the FARC in Colombia; the Zionist 
government of Israel has accused Iran, with no evidence, of sending shipments of 
arms to Palestine, and has suggested to the US the necessity of a strike against 
Iran's nuclear power plant. The American government, while considering various 
plans for intervention in Iran, is making the best use of the media to spread 
its propaganda and prepare American public opinion for its war and/or 
intervention in Iran. And if war comes to pass, the conservatives will have a 
stronger excuse to condemn all progressive struggles as a threat to the defense 
of the country, and in conflict with opposition to the imperialist war. And, 
certainly, the results of this war will include not only the agony of human 
suffering, but also the destruction of the country's infrastructure, which will 
in turn result in diverting the people's resources, even after the war, to the 
reconstruction effort, postponing the people's democratic movement, which right 
now is flourishing in Iran. It is very important that we work to support 
self-determination for the people of Iran to carry on their struggle, not only 
to defeat the ultra-right faction of the current government, but to eventually 
bring about a truly democratic and secular government in Iran, which has been 
tried many times in Iran and has been thwarted every time by US imperialist 
intervention.</p>

<P>What the people of Iran need today is the solidarity of the peace and justice 
movement to make sure the US does not make war on Iran.</P>
