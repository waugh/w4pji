<p>
Friday, March 3rd 6:30 - 9:00 pm<br>
Community Meeting on<br>
STOPPING WAR AGAINST IRAN<br>
Creating a Nuclear-Weapons-Free Middle East<br>
<p>
St. Stephen's Church (16th and Newton St. NW, Washington DC)
Refreshments will be served.<br>
From the Columbia Heights metro walk north on 14th, turn left on 
Newton and walk until you reach 16th. Enter on the side. There is 
wheelchair access at the back of the building.
<p>
The United States and Israel openly talk about plans to use military 
action against Iran to stop its nuclear program.  Can peace activists 
stop this war?  Can we once again put nuclear disarmament on the front 
burner?
<p>
Our three speakers, all of whom have extensive activist and media 
experience, will discuss this issue before activists break out into 
groups to discuss strategies for achieving these goals and report back 
to the larger group.
<p>
RAY MCGOVERN, former CIA analyst of Veteran Intelligence Professionals 
for Sanity. He will describe US and Israeli hypocrisy in criticizing 
Iran over compliance with the non-proliferation treaty, as well as 
dubious U.S. intelligence being used to build American support for 
attacking Iran.
<p>
SIMIN ROYANIAN, an economist, is a thirty-seven year veteran of the 
anti-imperialist and peace and justice movement in Iran and in the US 
who cofounded Women for Peace and Justice in Iran.  She will review
the history of the development of nuclear energy in Iran, discuss how
the US government uses the Iranian nuclear-energy program as a pretext
in preparing the Americans to support another US war in the Middle
East, towards its complete occupation and control of the the region
<a href="group1/2006-03-03_india.html">[transcript]</a>.
<p>
KEVIN MARTIN, Executive Director of Peace Action, will describe a
Middle East Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone (NWFZ). This was an idea issued
as a United Nations General Assembly resolution, and discuss how peace 
activists can work to rid the region of all nuclear weapons as a part
of larger efforts for nuclear disarmament.
<p>
Please join us for this important peace community meeting. War
against Iran could be underway this spring. We have no time to lose.
<p>
The forum is sponsored by the Washington Peace Center, the 
Hiroshima-Nagasaki Committee and the DC Anti-War Network.  For more
