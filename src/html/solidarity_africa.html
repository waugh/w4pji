<H2>Transcript of Simin Royanian's speech at African Women's Conference, Howard 
University, Washington, DC, 2002-03-09</H2>

<p>I wanted to thank the organizers of 
the conference for this wonderful, beautiful conference, and I wanted to say 
Happy International Women's Day, and remember that we celebrate this day to 
honor the struggle of the American working women in textile factories in New 
York City more than 90 years ago (that's right). And Laura Bush and company do 
not want to remember the working women in America: they celebrate International 
Women's Day, but they don't tell us whom we are honoring.</p>

<P>I want to start by reading you a poem and telling you a story. Martin 
Niemoeller, German Protestant minister: "When the Nazis came for the communists, 
I did not speak out because I was not a communist. When they came for the trade 
unionists, I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. When they 
came for the Jews, I did not speak out because I was a not a Jew. Then they came 
for me, and there was no one left to speak for me." (applause).</p>

<P>In 1980 I went to Iran with my three-year-old American daughter after the 
masses of Iran had won a revolution against the monarchy imposed on us by the 
CIA in 1953. The people of Iran were so angry at the CIA agents that they took 
over the American embassy. I was there with two brothers, a representative of 
ZANU PF and a representative of a socialist organization from Sweden. And I was 
in front of the embassy among the masses of Iranian people. And my comrade from 
Sweden says "I want to take a picture, but I can't see over the heads of the 
people." And my brother from ZANU says "Man, I'll bend over and you climb up on 
my shoulders and you can see." So the Black man bends over and the white man 
starts to climb, and all the Iranians around me pull him down. And I say "they 
are brothers", but the people say "No, not in this land, a white man will not 
get on the back of a Black man." (applause)</p>

<P>I am here today representing an organization called the DC Emergency Response 
Network on Iraq. This organization was formed in 1991 when the American military 
attacked the people of Iraq, and its bombs killed the children. This attack 
still continues after 12 years, and every month some 500 Iraqi children die 
because of the bombs and because of the lack of medicine and food. We have 
marched on the streets of Washington for peace in Yugoslavia, for peace in 
Somalia, for peace all over the world, and most recently, for peace in 
Afghanistan.</p>

<P>Peace is the most important concern of the women of this world. War is a 
horror but it is so much more so for women and children. When war happens they 
kill our brothers and our sons and our husbands, and then they rape us and they 
rape our daughters and they bomb our homes, and they kick us out, and we become 
refugees. And we live for 50 years in the refugee camps of Palestine and we 
become mothers and grandmothers and we live in the refugee camps and they come 
today and bomb us and kill our pregnant women at the border checkpoints. 
<P>War brings about the most horrors on our communities of color in this 
country. These horrors, coupled with the feminization of poverty, impose great 
suffering on women of color. They take our brothers to fight the imperialist 
wars of the American government. And they spread drugs in our communities, then 
they announce what they call a "war on drugs". They kill the Black Panthers and 
assassinate Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. They demolish Move, and they 
fight against the women of color just because they happen to be poor and they 
call it "welfare reform".</p>

<P>I am here today as an Iranian woman, whose country is under threat of being 
bombed by US imperialism. I am here today as a Kurdish woman whose villages were 
poisoned by the same Saddam Hussein who bought the poisons from Germany and got 
his guns from the US military. I'm here as a woman of the Middle East. I have 
walked on the deserts of Afghanistan and become a refugee in Iran.
<!-- She doesn't mean this literally.  She's speaking in
     metaphorical identification with the women affected by war.
-->
I'm a Kurdish 
woman who has held her children and walked up the mountains in the snow and the 
cold, and then been killed by the military of Turkey, that gets its guns from US 
imperialists.</p>

<P>I'm a woman. I'm a mother. I'm a grandmother. I'm a sister; I'm a wife. I am 
tired. </p>

<P>Do not take my sons away. I did not give birth to sons so they could become 
killers in your imperialist wars (all right, applause). I did not give birth to 
my children so you could drive them to the refugee camps all over Africa and 
they have to sell their bodies in the refugee camps for food. I'm a mother; 
don't bomb my children. I'm a mother of this earth; give my children back. 
</P>
