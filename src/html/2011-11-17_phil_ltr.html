<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Dear
friends,</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As
you probably know, the Obama administration has just publicly charged
that Iranian government agents have been plotting to assassinate the
Saudi ambassador to the United States. Washington is now using this
outrageous claim to try and rally support for new sanctions against
the Islamic Republic, isolate it in the international arena and
prepare world opinion for the possibility of a U.S.-led military
attack. (For the Iranian response, please see the attached letter.)</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Why
do I say the charge is outrageous? Think about it for just one
minute. </FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The
U.S. government is claiming that the alleged assassination plot was
hatched by members of the Quds, a military force the Associated Press
today describes as &quot;Iran's special foreign actions unit.&quot;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">But
when the Quds want to carry out a highly sensitive military
operation, one that could have enormous repercussions for Iran's own
security and its relations with its neighbors, who does this elite
unit supposedly turn to? A hit man for a Mexican drug cartel! Who
presumably, if he were caught, would go to his grave rather than
admit he was hired by Iranians!</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Here's
what U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had to say on the
matter: &quot;The idea that they would attempt to go to a Mexican
cartel to solicit murder-for-hire to kill the Saudi ambassador,
nobody could make that up, right?&quot; (Associated Press, 10/12/11)</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Sure
they could, Madam Secretary. You could. So could the same people who
lied to us about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction, ties to
al-Qaeda and responsibility for 9/11. You guys lie all the time.
That's your job.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Iran
hasn't attacked another country in more than 200 years. Its
government works day and night to improve its relations with its
mainly Muslim neighbors. But as ludicrous as the assassination plot
charge is, it comes at a very serious time.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The
U.S. has at least temporarily succeeded in derailing the Egyptian
revolution, whose success could have seriously undermined
Washington's strategy for control of the Middle East. The government
of Libya has been overthrown, opening up Africa's largest oil
reserves to Western exploitation. The Syrian government, which for
all its failings has at least been willing to stand up to the U.S.,
is looking increasingly shaky. Pro-U.S. despots in Yemen, Pakistan
and Saudi Arabia seem to be weathering the storms of the Arab Spring.
All this is encouraging the still powerful neocons in Washington to
push harder for a more aggressive stand against Iran, the one country
in the region economically, politically and militarily capable of
opposing U.S. hegemony in the Middle East, home to two-thirds of the
world's known oil reserves.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Progressives
in the US. have one overriding international obligation: to do all we
can to prevent &quot;our&quot; government from attacking, imposing
sanctions, embargoes or blockades or interfering in any way in the
internal affairs of those countries formerly colonized, exploited or
oppressed by the US. or other Western powers. This is the acid test
for any U.S. activist who wants be considered part of progressive
humanity.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This
Saturday, Oct. 15, will see protests around the country against the
U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I urge all of us to strongly
support and attend these protests and to raise the demand &quot;No
war, sanctions or internal interference in Iran!&quot; as well as
&quot;Stop the U.S./NATO war against Libya!&quot; and &quot;Money for
Jobs, not for War!&quot;</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The
time to stop a war is before it starts. Please, let's do it this
time.</FONT></P>
