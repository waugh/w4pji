Royanian comments:
<p>
It is not an "insurgency". It is a war of resistance
against the illegal US war on the people of Iraq, a
war the US carries on in
violation of international law. According to Webster,
insurgency is a revolt against a government by its
citizens. The Iraqi people are fighting against the
US army. The use of this word to refer to the Iraqi
resistance constitutes a <u>political assertion</u>
 that the war of the US
in Iraq has ended in victory, that a democratic,
indigenous Iraqi government is ruling the country, and
then, that there is an insurgency by a portion of the
citizens against their own government. As usual with
the Conservatives, this is a lie. The fact is that
there is a war in Iraq (in fact the US government
agrees that a war is going on) and since there is no
Iraqi government or army, the people's resistance is
carrying on the war of resistance against their
occupiers.
<p>
Quoting Malik further:
<p>
<i>But Sunni Arabs, being a minority, can't come to
power through the Jan. 30 elections. This is why most
of them are boycotting the vote.</i>
<p>
Responding:
<p>
Mr. Malik continues in total denial of reality.
The current resistance of the Iraqi people did not
begin as a response to the announcement of the
elections. It is the continuation of the resistance to
the occupation.  This resistance began very early and has
been waged continuously against the US army and its
co-conspirators and spies within Iraq. In the USA, the
fashion is to forget history even as recent as 2003.
When the resistance against the war started, the
US government and its pundits and its media
declared that the resistance was spearheaded by the
Shia leaders who had taken refuge in Iran during the
Hussein rule. They reported that the Shia Badr army,
trained in Iran, was coming to Iraq to fight the US.
Ever since the beginning of this war, the resistance
has moved across the country, involving a cross section
of the people. We read of Sadr and his poor working-class
supporters in Sadr City; we read of the uprising in Najaf,
one of the bloodiest massacre of the Iraqi people,
Najaf being the holiest city of Shias. This is a
guerrilla war, an underground resistance, which
smolders among masses of supporters, showing
itself as opportunities arise,
in the tradition of all guerrilla wars.
<p>
The attributes of Sunni or Shia do not define or
explain the resistance, since the resistance is not by
Sunnis against Shias or vice versa. All the attacks
of the resistance, whether happening in a city with
majority Sunni or majority Shia population, are
against the occupation forces.
<p>
On the one hand, the US government and its ideologues
characterize the liberation movements of the people of
the Middle East in terms of Islam against the
"Judeochristian, Western civilization", but now they tell
us that in Iraq it is a war of one section of Moslems
against the others.
<p>
The differences of opinions among the individuals who
are Shia or Sunni are like the differences among
various Protestant sects in the US, at best. Saddam
Hussein created political division among the ruling
class of the Shia and the Sunnis, by oppressing the
majority Shia, especially in the interest of his
alliance against Iran and its Islamic government, which
is of Shia belief. Then when Hussein became the US
enemy in 1991, the US tried to bolster the grievances
of the Shia majority against Hussein's government to
fight Hussein. If it is true that the Sunnis' and
Shias' differences are the determining factors in the
wars of the US against the Middle East people, how come
these issues were not in existence prior to the
establishment of the Islamic government in Iran.
The notion of a strong hostility between the Sunni
and Shia people
is an invention of the CIA, Pentagon and neocon
ideologues.
<p>
<i>A pro-Iranian electoral alliance of the Shi'ite
majority is
predicted to win a majority of parliamentary seats
and form
the government. The Iranians are helping the
alliance with money
and volunteers, . . .</i>
<p>
Where are the documents, pictures, films, and independent
journalist reports of this?  It is amazing
how the standard of journalism has evaporated in the
USA. It is interesting that the Washington Post
reported that the King of Jordan has reported that up
to a million Iranians have crossed the border with
Iraq to influence the elections. One should wonder
who has better knowledge of border crossings from Iran
to Iraq? The CIA and the American special forces or
the King of Jordan?
<p>
When I mentioned this to a 78-year-old Iranian woman
visiting here, she said "How can so many Iranians cross
the border without anyone noticing? Who is feeding
them? Where are they staying?"
<p>
Even if the number were much smaller, it would be
conspicuous for a bunch of non-Arab,
non-Arabic-speaking persons, or at best speaking
Arabic with a
Persian accent, trying to influence the vote of the
people of Iraq. The same Post article was saying that
the King claimed these Iranians were going to vote.
What kind of a reliable election can this be if a
bunch of foreigners can vote and not be prevented from
voting due to lack of identification as Iraqi citizens?
<p>
<i>. . . ignoring President Bush's warnings against "meddling
in the internal affairs of Iraq."</i>
<p>
While those of us who believe in the rule of
international law believe that the government of one
country must not interfere in the internal affairs of
another, Bush, who has occupied a whole country, is the
last source for reminding others of international law.
If there were a legitimate government in Iraq, and it
had documented interference by the government of Iran,
then they could give a warning to the government of Iran.
The Iranian Government does not have to listen to
warnings by Bush, who has violated international
law by attacking and occupying Iraq, violating the Geneva
convention and the Convention against Torture, in
addition to a long list of other violations.
If Mr. Malik believes that one government should not
interfere with the internal affairs of another, why
does he not oppose the interference of the US in Iraq?
<p>
<i>The war to overthrow Saddam [Hussein], a bitter enemy of
Israel, was
masterminded by a group of neoconservatives, and
Patrick Buchanan and others accused them of dragging
America into "Israel's war."</i>
<p>
No. This is not Israel's war. This the American
Imperialist war against the people of the Middle East.
Does it serve the interest of the right wing
government of Israel and the interest of Zionism? Yes.
But the people of Israel, along with the rest of
the people of Middle East, are paying for the
interest of global capital in the oil and gas of
the middle East.
<p>
Mr. Malik is again turning facts on their head. It is
not Israel which has the biggest army in human
history. It is not Israel sending its soldiers all
over the world fighting any native people who dare to
want to be free, from Colombia to Timor, from
Indonesia to North Korea, From North Africa to South
and West Africa to East.
<p>
The enemy of the people of the Middle East and the
people everywhere, including North America, is the
global capital class headed by the US and its war
machine.
<p>
<i>Now Arab commentators are saying that America is
fighting "Iran's war."</i>
<p>
Which Arab commentators? And what does that mean?
Which Iran War? Iran does not have a war. Iran was
involved in an 8 year war with the government of
Hussein, to defend itself, while Hussein had the
support of the US politically, economically
and militarily.
Hussein militarily attacked Iran just as he attacked
Kuwait. Since Iran is a bigger and stronger nation,
the war lasted for 8 years.
<p>
Iran has never been an aggressor, has not initiated
any war. Iran does not have a war.
<p>
The people of Iran are brothers and sisters with the
people of Iraq. Their sons and daughters are married
to each other.  During the war with Iraq many family
relations were severed and people lost touch with
their family members. After the end of the war and the
attack of the US on Iraq in 1991, many Iraqis took
refuge in Iran. The Iranian people accepted them and
they are now part of Iran, which adds more to the
family connections among the people of the two countries.
Now, people are moving back and forth and locating
their families.
<p>
Also, Iraq houses the most important
Shia religious schools and shrines of the religion.
The people of Iran are interested in peace in Iraq
and preservation of the religious places.
<p>
<i>The US invasion has, besides facilitating the
creation of a pro-Iranian government in Baghdad . . .</i>
<p>
This government is not created yet. If the US is
successful in establishing a "government" in Iraq, just
like the Karzai "government" in Afghanistan, under
the supervision of American military, it will be a
pro-American "Government", just as Pinochet was a
"pro-American Government". In fact these are not
pro-American but they are American viceroys in
occupied land, with faces and accents of the natives.
If the majority happens to have a Shia religion, it
does not necessarily mean that they are politically
supporters of Iran. Even if they feel some affinity
towards Iran, it is not the fault of Iran, and why
shouldn't the governments of two neighboring nations
be friends and in peace?
<p>
<i> . . . Iraq stays in one piece, the Iranians are likely to
exert influence on its politics and policies through
its Shi'ite majority.
<p>
Iran isn't the only "fox" making hay from the fall
of Saddam.</I>
<p>
Why is Iran the Fox? If inadvertently, a Shia
majority comes to power, and according to the
Americans, it is democratic, which means it will not
oppress the Sunnis, but it will represent the
composition of the people of Iraq, and as a result of
the fact that the Shias in Iran and Iraq have a long
history of familial, religious, and cultural
interaction, they will influence each other, it will
make Iran a fox? Also, this assumes that the people of
Iraq are necessarily more influenced by their
religious beliefs that their national beliefs and
other secular ideologies.
<p>
It is true that due to the Christian and anti-Islamic
rhetoric of the neocons, the movements of the Middle
Eastern people may tend to ally themselves with
Islamic politics, and it is the US policies which have
undermined the possibilities of strong secular
democratic movements and governments. After all the
strongest allies of the US in the Middle East are two
governments based on exclusive religious ideology,
Saudi Arabia and Israel.
<p>
<i>The war has mobilized anti-American and anti regime
forces in the
region to an unprecedented level. Muslim guerrillas
from neighboring countries have joined the Iraqi
insurgency. Islamist activists have ratcheted up
their campaign against Jordanian and
Saudi Arabian monarchies, citing these regimes'
tacit support for the US invasion of Iraq.</i>
<p>
What is wrong with opposing the dictatorial,
anti-people monarchies in these countries? Does the
commentator support the rule of Saudis? In fact the
only reason they exist is because the English
colonialists established them and the American
imperialists support them. They have no right to rule
the people of those countries.
<p>
<i>An Arab-American friend who has returned from a tour
of the region tells me that in Jordan's cafes and
college campuses King Abdullah II is being "openly
denounced" as America's "lackey" "collaborator."</i>
<p>
What is wrong with that? This shows that the people of
Jordan are intelligent, knowledgeable, and brave and
use their right to free expression of ideas to tell
the truth.
<p>
<i>My friend had not seen Jordanians criticize the
monarchy so harshly and publicly before.</i>
<p>
Why should your friend be surprised? Of course the
criticism of the American lackeys has intensified
after the occupation of Iraq and especially after the
exposure of the tortures in Abu Ghraib. And this is a
good sign from the point of view of resistance to
US intervention in the Middle East.
<p>
<i>Unprecedented, too, was the recent attempt to stage
antigovernment
demonstrations in Saudi Arabia. The London-based
Movement for Islamic Reforms, which US intelligence
sources suspect is linked to Osama bin Laden, . . .</i>
<p>
Linked by whom? What is the evidence? Today, anyone
who opposes the crimes of the USA, is said to be
"linked" to Bin Laden.
<p>
Why do we not discuss whether a protest against the
dictatorial, criminal, anti-human rights rule of the
Saudi family is a right thing to do or not? Yes it is
good news that the resistance to the rule of the Saudi
Family (who for sure are linked to Bin Laden), is a
good thing for the people of Saudi Arabia.
<p>
<i>. . . called for the protest. Hundreds of activists were
preparing to
pour into the streets of Riyadh and Jeddah when
police dispersed them.</i>
<p>
So do you stand with the police who prevent people
from expressing, in a demonstration, their opinion
about their government? Is this not a democratic
right?
<p>



<i>Maybe America is fighting bin Laden's war, too.</i>
<p>
As far as I remember Bin Laden was employed by the US
to fight the US fight in Afghanistan?
So as far as the people of the Middle East are concerned,
Bin Laden is embedded with the US.
They are fighting their war on the land of the people
of the Middle East.<hr>
