Statement Against US Government's Invasion and Occupation of Iraq</p>
</h1>
<p>
Members of Women for Peace and Justice in Iran distributed the text below as a leaflet at the 2003-04-12 Washington, DC&nbsp;ANSWER rally against the US war on Iraq.</p>

<p>
We are marching today in a continuous effort to promote peace and justice for the people of Iraq, the Middle East and the world. We are marching to express our complete opposition to and condemnation of the US invasion and occupation of Iraq.</p>
<p>
We are marching today because we believe that the survival of the people of the world depends on a lasting world peace. That peace is only possible through social, economic, and environmental justice for all people of any age, ability, gender, nationality, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political ideology, religious belief or secular outlook.</p>
<p>
The US government has supported dictatorial regimes in almost every Middle Eastern and Arab country, especially the autocratic rulers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</p>
<p>
The US government has opposed all democratic movements of the people of the Middle East and, in 1953, the CIA carried out a coup to overthrow a democratic popular government in Iran and establish the rule of the dictatorial Shah of Iran.</p>
<p>
The US government helped found and support Al Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>
The US government supported Saddam Hussein during most of his dictatorial rule in Iraq, his 8 year war with Iran, and his continuous oppression of the Kurdish people including his chemical attack on them.</p>
<p>
The CIA opposition to the democratic government of Iran was because of that government's nationalization of the Iran oil resources. The US government has been interested in control of the Middle East for its oil resources. To achieve this goal, the US government has carried out all forms of violation of human rights, self determination and sovereignty of the people of the Middle East.</p>
<p>
The people of the Middle East are in solidarity with the people of the US, but are opposed to political, economic and military intervention by the US government in their affairs.</p>
<p>
At this time, the US government continues to support the Israeli violation of the human rights of the Palestinian people and the occupation of their land, it has occupied half of Kuwait, turning it into a US military base, it has established its own puppet government in Afghanistan and its soldiers carry on military operations there against any opposition by the people of Afghanistan, and while it is occupying Iraq, it has started threatening the people of Syria and Iran and Dick Chaney talks of future military initiatives in the area.</p>
<p>
These are the reasons that we march and encourage the peace and justice movement to demand:<ul>
<li>
<p>
Total withdrawal of all US forces from Iraq and the Middle East</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
United Nations control of the humanitarian effort in Iraq</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
United Nations resolution in support of self determination for the People of Iraq</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Referendum under the supervision of the UN for the people of Iraq to determine their own destiny.</p>
</li>
</ul>
