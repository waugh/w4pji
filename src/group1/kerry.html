<font face="Arial">In this file (http://women4peace.org/kerry.html), </font><a href=""><font face="Arial">we</font></a><font face="Arial"> offer links and commentary in support of an analysis that from an anti-imperialist viewpoint, the world may be even worse off with &quot;Democrat&quot; John Kerry replacing George W. Bush as President of the United States of America. This is not to argue for any support of George Bush and the Republican Party, but to suggest that the support of the Democratic Party's candidate by progressive people will serve the interest of the American empire.</font></p>

To send a credible message of stewardship and transition to self-rule, <i>we</i> need a truly international coalition, including key Arab nations like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. As Thomas Friedman put it, '<i>If it is America alone against the Iraqi street, <b>we</b> lose. If it is the world against the Iraqi street, <b>we</b> have a chance</i>' [<font face="Arial">emphasis ours</font>].</p>

<font face="Arial">So we can see that MoveOn, as the most progressive arm of the Democratic Party, wants the United States of America to win against the Iraqi people. Moveon's quote confirms the position of the </font><i><font face="Arial">CounterPunch</font></i><font face="Arial"> article that the &quot;Democrats&quot; want to win by allying more national governments in support of the US imperialist policies for control of the world.</font></p>

A Democrat contingent could straighten out the situation in Iraq and achieve what President Bush seems unable to.</p>

I'm a little suspicious of this type of reasoning, to be honest. There are many reasons, e.g. future nominations to the Supreme Court, to try to defeat George [W.] Bush. Foreign policy is a major component, but not the only one.</p>

<font face="Arial">Maybe so, but it is the USA Empire's foreign policy that affects the tremendous billions of people in the Third World. Even if the &quot;Democrats&quot; carried out better domestic policies (which is not true ever since conservatives such as Bill Clinton took over -- recall that Clinton implemented &quot;Welfare Reform&quot;), it still holds true that to decide issues only on their effect on the people in the USA (and even then, excluding most of the poor working class in the USA), is a non-tenable position from an anti-imperialist point of view, one that puts the interest of USA citizens above the rest of the people of the world.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial">Well-intentioned citizens of Third World countries may vote based on domestic policies, since these countries do not dominate and exploit the rest of the world. But in the USA, the <b>superpower empire</b> of the world, votes and actions based on domestic policies alone, in the final analysis, will serve the interest of the <b>Empire</b>.</font></p>
