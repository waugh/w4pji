<P>I will discuss the economic issues of globalization of capital and its 
relationships to the structural adjustment policies. I will present an overview 
of global capital and its strategies since the 90's, its anti-union actions, and 
sweat shops. Then from the general discussion, I will continue on to the 
specific effects on women and then, discuss Iran as a case study. 
<P>Globalization of capital has been a continuous process of the growth of world 
capitalism. In the 80’s the neoliberal ideologues won power in the US and the UK 
and started the implementation of their economic policies at home and in the 
peripheral countries. In the early 80’s they implemented these policies through 
the Structural Adjustment Policies (SAPS) of World Bank and the IMF. In the 90’s 
they expanded the scope of the neoliberal policies through the WTO. 
<P>All these policies have had overreaching negative economic consequences for 
the people of the Third World countries and specifically for the working-class 
families. The effects of these policies intensify in the case of women. Examples 
of these policies are the reduction and in some cases the elimination of many 
social welfare programs in health, food and housing subsidies. 
<P>There are several basic reasons for this: 
<UL>
  <LI>Women on the average are poorer in earnings and asset holdings. 
  <LI>Women have less geographic, social and economic mobility, making it harder 
  to create alternatives. 
  <LI>Women tend to be caregivers for the old and the children so their burden 
  is heavier. 
  <LI>Women are the majority dependent on social welfare programs. Therefore, 
  elimination or reduction in these programs affects them in larger proportion 
  than men. 
  <LI>A larger percentage of women workers tend to work in sweatshop conditions 
  and non-union work places. </LI></UL>
<P>Iran is a case that fits this norm. The development of this process in Iran 
has been slower in some aspects compare to some other third World countries in 
Latin America and Asia. The reason for this is that the Iranian economy was not 
integrated into the global system at the same rate due to the US sanctions. The 
other reason was the isolation of the Iranian economy due to the uncertain 
nature of the revolution and the war. Once the war ended and the government 
established itself, the Iranian economy became a good place for European 
investors. Beginning in the 1990's, the growth of neoliberal ideology and 
policies, and the increasing support for them in Iran, helped to push forward 
their implementation. The economic rhetoric of the radical faction has subsided, 
especially with the elimination of its support from the ranks of the power 
structure in Iran. 
<P>The result has been the increase in health cost, education cost even to the 
degree of fees for public schools, elimination of all sorts of subsidies for 
shelter and food, privatization of public services and some utilities, and 
finally the intensification of sweatshop working conditions especially for women 
in textile and carpet producing sectors. All the elements listed previously 
define the conditions of the women of the working class and poor families in 
Iran today. The woman who live under these difficult conditions in Iran are not 
limited to the traditional blue-collar workers, but increasingly includes the 
service sector where many women work. These include office workers, teachers and 
nurses. One of the devastating effects of the neoliberal economic policies is 
the increase in the gap between the poor and the rich. This results in the 
decrease in the middle class, which pushes many of them into the poor category. 
Globally, the neoliberal economic policies have produced the feminization of 
poverty. This phenomenon is very prevalent in Iran where women are very limited 
in the area of trade due to the social constraints. 
<P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>Many of the social ills of the Iranian society and 
specifically the problems with the rights of women are attributable to the 
Islamic nature of the laws and the societal rules. The economic problems facing 
Iran today, however, are mainly the result of the position of Iran in the 
neo-liberal global economic system of today’s world. 
<P>The world capitalist system has been facing a declining rate of profit for 
several decades. In the 80’s the implementation of the SAP were one of the tools 
used to intensify exploitation and thus, increase the profit rate. In the 90’s 
the continuing struggle for profits manifested itself in the form of expansion 
of neoliberal policies through organizations such as the WTO. These policies 
have lead to the increase in the gap between the global north and the global 
south. Iran, which is among the global south economies, has been losing ground. 
The accumulation of capital necessary to build the infrastructure for economic 
development has become ever more so difficult and elusive. Consequently, the 
Government of Iran has implemented the SAP and neo-liberal policies to attract 
some foreign capital and privatize the assets of the country to buy itself some 
time. Thus, the answer to the economic sufferings of the women in Iran is not 
the change in the Islamic government to a secular neoliberal system. Strong 
countries of the global south, such as Brazil, that have implemented neoliberal 
economic policies, are going bankrupt. 
<P>These policies are having the same effect in Iran. The only way to bring 
about economic justice for all, and thus, free women from their economic 
hardships and from the social injustices that accompany their lack of economic 
power, is to struggle against the hegemony of the global capital.
