What is happening at this time?
<p>
While the Bush administration claims victory in the
trip by Bush and Rice to Europe, in reality it was a
defeat for the US government.
<p>
Bush and company were hoping to twist the arm of the
Europeans to put pressure on Iran. They were not
successful. In fact with respect to Russia they failed
miserably since they had tried to convince the Russian
government to refrain from signing the contract to
provide the Iranian government with the fuel for the
nuclear energy plant. Right after the return of Bush,
the Iranians and the Russians signed the contract.
<p>
Although Bush and company say that they and the
Europeans came to a new agreement, which is that
Iran must not develop nuclear weapons, this is a
restatement of the existing facts about Iran. By
signing the NPT, Iran has agreed not to develop nuclear
weapons, and the Europeans, who are also signatories,
have always held that no country should develop new
nuclear weapons. This has been the basis of Russia's
agreement to provide nuclear energy technology to
Iran.
<p>
In fact, it is clear that Bush and company have been
forced to reduce their rhetoric after their visit to
Europe. Right after their return, it was reported that
Bush is talking of offering some "carrot" to Iran as an
incentive to prevent them from developing nuclear
weapons.
<p>
This shows that although Bush said all alternatives are
on the table (which definitely is the long term plan
of the neoconservatives), for the time being they are
retreating and regrouping.
<p>
This issue also falls in line with the decision to
interrupt Rice's visit and have her cancel her
Middle East visits.
<p>
Although the Administration claims it was because of
human rights violations in Egypt, that is not the
truth, because before planning the visit they were
aware of human rights violations both in Egypt and in
Saudi Arabia. However, after their defeat in Europe
and the demonstrations and oppositions of the people
in Europe, it became clear to them that it was no time
for Rice to visit the Middle East.
<p>
I was recently visiting Cairo and the support of the
people in Cairo for Iran and its revolution was
palpable and clearly expressed. This is important in
the face of the fact that Egypt is a majority Sunni
Arab county, and one which is theoretically a "friend of
the US".
<p>
Bush and Rice learned from their European trip that,
at a time when they are threatening Iran, which is
loved and supported by the masses of people in Moslem
countries, a visit by Rice will be devastating for the US.
<p>
Another event which has made the US government
retreat momentarily is the situation in Palestine.
As we know, US/Iran and Israel/Palestine
relations are intertwined. The Iranian government has
been opposed to the "Road Map to Peace" promoted by
the US government. And the US government has referred
to this as one of the reasons that Iran is supporting
"terrorism".
<p>
The Bush administration was hoping that with the death of
Arafat (which they gleefully celebrated), and offering
carrots to Abbas, inducing him to turn the guns of
the Palestinian Authority
security forces against the Palestinian resisters,
they could present "a Peace" to the Israeli People.
If they were successful in that, it is easier for
Sharon to offer the bitter pill of going to war with
Iran to the Israeli people.
<p>
However, we have seen that recently there was another
attack inside Israel.
<p>
Again, while they are retreating a bit from their
threats against Iran, they try to keep the issue alive
by resurrecting the old story of the Pakistani
nuclear scientist.
<p>
The other game they are playing is to increase their
pressure against Syria while they are regrouping about
Iran. So, as soon as the Lebanese ex-premier is
assassinated, the US claims it is done by Syria without
one trace of evidence. While the Lebanese government
is trying to investigate the assassination,
the US whips up anti-Syria accusations and tries
its hand at destabilizing another country in the
Middle East. Syria is attacked for all the problems of
Lebanon as though it were not the Israelis who attacked
Lebanon, bombed Beirut in the 80's, and occupied south
Lebanon, and it as though it were
not the fascist elements which
intensified the civil war, giving rise to the
popularity of the Lebanon Hezbollah.
<p>
So, now, the US shows a face of threat and agression
toward the people of Lebanon, as it has
already been doing toward the people of Iraq, Iran,
and Syria.
<p>
So this setback for Bush and Co. buys Iran a little
bit more time. Scott Ritter has said that the Pentagon
plan for attacking Iran has been June of this year;
let's hope it does not come to pass.
