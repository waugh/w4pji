Subject: Inaccurate depiction of Iranian Opposition Group on DC Indymedia

The following announcement appeared on the DC Indymedia's site:
<p>
"1000's of Iranian-Americans rally in support of the Mojahedin"
<p>
This is an inaccurate representation of Iranian community and 
their support
of Mojahedin-e Khalq. This group does not have any significant 
support
inside or outside of Iran.
<p>
This message is to say something about the origin and nature of 
this 
group for readers who might like to know.  This sort of thing 
matters 
because one of the means that the warmongers have of promoting 
their 
position is to use groups that are willing to work with them.
<p>
The group in question here is the Modjaahedin, an Islamic 
organization
with army with tanks (as depicted on their web site) and not a 
peace group
at all.  They also call themselves the Iranian  Resistance and 
National
Liberation Army.  They have never showed up at a peace demo.  
They support
the demonization of the regime in Iran, similar to the US 
propaganda
treatment of Hussein in Iraq.  They want to play the role in 
Iran that
Ahmad Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress plays in Iraq. 
Of course, there is no need to say that they do not respect 
complete human
rights for women since they believe in an Islamic type 
governement.  In
their
website you will see that thir army of women has islamic scarf 
and carries
guns. 
<p>
During the Iran-Iraq war, the Modjaahedin supported the Hussein 
regime. 
Not a verbal or idealogical support.  Actual military support.  
Saddam
Hussein had allowed them to build army camps in Iraq next to the 
Iranian
border and during the war they were militarily engaged against 
Iran and on
the side of Saddam Hussein's army.  Needless to say, this lead 
to the
people of Iran of all walks of life to despise them.
<p>
US Congress members met with and encouraged the Modjaahedin as 
an
alternative to the Islamic Republic or as a tool of US to 
overthrow the
Islamic government.  Not surprisingly, the Modjaahedin are not 
popular
among the Iranian people or the peace and Justice movement of 
Iran.
<p>
When the US foreign-policy machine turned around and designated 
Saddam
Hussein as one of their hitlers-of-the-month, they reclassified 
the
Modjaahedin as a "terrorist" organization.
<p>
Eventually the Modjaahedin kissed up to Washington and recently 
said they
would reveal where the Islamic Republic of Iran kept its 
weapons, claiming
that years of military operation on the border of Iraq and Iran 
makes them
great experts at the service of the US.  This was reported in 
the
Washington post just before the invasion of Iraq.
<p>
They are only interested in coming to power in Iran with the 
help of the US
government.
