Iranian women celebrated International Women’s Day
(IWD) 2005 in Tehran and various
cities in Iran.  Two of the celebrations reported were
in Sanandaj and Saggez, two Kurdish cities in Iran.
All of the celebrations were organized by NGO’s.
<p>
In Sanandaj 3000 men and women participated in this
celebration organized by a women’s organization,
The Society for Support of Women (<a href=
"http://www.zanann.com/"
>web site</a> in Persian).
<p>
There were speeches by various members of this
organization and others including one by a youth
organization. The speech from the youth organization
was delivered by a young man.
<p>
The declaration for IWD in Sannandaj included demands
for the rights of women such as
(these are informal translations from the Persian
text):<ul>
<li>We condemn Gender Apartheid.
<li>Equal rights for men and women in all social,
economic and political arenas.
<li>We condemn all forms of violence against women.
<li>We demand equal pay for equal work.
<li>Homemakers are workers. We demand
health, disability, and retirement benefits for
them. 
<li>Spouses and children of the working class suffer
under harsh living conditions. We support all demands
of the workers such as wage increases and family
welfare programs.</ul>
<p>
The speeches related the rights of women to the
oppression of global capital.
<p>
The speeches and demands show a level of feminist
consciousness that extends to issues of class and the
oppression of the capitalist system.
<p>
I hope to have enough time to translate more news
and documents of the activities of women, workers,
peace and environmental activists in Iran.
<p>
This is news that Americans do not hear and
should be spread among the people so that they do not
carry on the orientalist and colonialist images of the
people in the Third World.
