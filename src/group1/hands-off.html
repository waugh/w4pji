US HANDS OFF IRAN</p>
</center>
</h1>
<p>
The US neo-conservatives intend to take over the world and control all resources and people to the last detail. They are overt about their intent to start with the Middle East. They will not stop with Afghanistan and Iraq; <b>Iran is next</b>, and they will not stop there either. The peoples’ movements must do everything possible to stop the march to world domination as soon as possible; the movements have to anticipate the neo-cons’ next move and step in their path!</p>
<p>
The recent student demonstrations in Iran reflect aspirations for a democratic and just society. We support the right of the Iranian people to continue their century-long struggle against dictatorship <b><i>and</i></b> colonial intervention.</p>
<p>
Bush Administration hawks have been waiting to exploit such an opportunity. They pretend to champion freedom in order to whitewash the 1953 CIA coup and once again return Iran's hated corrupt elite to power. Washington's jubilant attempts to whip up tension in Iran are a cynical project to distract Iranians while their hard-earned independence is being stolen.</p>
<p>
People in Iran have every right to choose their path to self-determination. Iranians could in 1979 overthrow a monarchy armed to the teeth by the US, and they are capable of changing their government without foreign interference today. The best evidence of this is that Iran's ruling clerics have not succeeded in forcing the indigenous opposition underground.</p>
<p>
The true motive for US meddling in Iran is to gain strategic control of oil with more military bases. This would pave the way for the Bush Administration's declared vision of a Middle East Free Trade Area for the benefit of American corporations.</p>
<p>
True supporters of peace with justice should not be fooled by Iranian American activists pushing their hidden agenda as human rights. Iranian monarchists have received coaching from the same publicists who sold the false story of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction to the public this year. Not every opponent of Iran's dictatorship is worthy of your sympathy. We ask the American peace and justice movement to express its unequivocal opposition to any form of US interference in Iran.</p>
