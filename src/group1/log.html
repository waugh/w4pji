is no capital punishnment at the international court, they

The peoples of both countries come under threat from the same source -- the US imperialist government, as do many other people all over the world. The people of Iran have always stood in solidarity with the people of Cuba. Ever since the 1979 revolution in Iran, the relationship between the two nations has strengthened. The people's movement is spreading everywhere, as witnessed most recently by the movement of the workers, peasants, and students in Bolivia. We believe that it is only with the solidarity of all the oppressed peoples and nations of the world that we can save the world from the oppression of global capital and the threats of the US military.</font></p>
