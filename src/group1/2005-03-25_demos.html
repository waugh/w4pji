On the second anniversary of the US war on Iraq, the
Iranian people marched for peace in solidarity with
the ranks of peace loving
people across the world.
<p>
Here are some slogans from the antiwar protest in
Tehran on the second anniversary of the US war on
Iraq.
<ul>
<li>
No to war and Dictatorship, Yes to Freedom
<p><li>
We oppose war, we oppose globalization
<p><li>
Solidarity, solidarity
<p><li>
Work for national, regional and world solidarity
<p><li>
 War is the policy of Globalization
<p><li>
 Globalization of Capital is the globalization of war
and poverty
<p><li>
Stop this Savage Trade in War
<p><li>
War never, Life forever
<p><li>
We must make the anniversary of the US war on Iraq
into a day of struggle against all forms of oppression
<p><li>
Join the anti-war movement
<p><li>
War is the Most Cruel violence
<p><li>
Women and children are the first victims of war
</ul>
<p>
It is very important to spread the news of the
antiwar sentiments of the people of Iran.    It is
important to realize that there is solidarity among
the people of the Middle East. The Iraq government
under the rule of Saddam Hussein, with the
encouragement and support of the US government,
imposed an 8- year war on Iran.    The people of Iran,
however, are opposed to war and its devastations; they
do not have animosity against the people of Iraq. 
If the people of Iran show their opposition of a US
war on Iraq, no one should believe the lies of the US
government that the Iranian people would welcome US
government intervention in their internal affairs.
