<H2>and to People throughout the World</H2>
Speech at Highway of Death commemoration, Washington, DC, March 15, 2002.

<P>Preliminary Draft (Version for first distribution). 
<HR>

<P>We have gathered here tonight at a time when the Israeli Government is on a 
mission to annihilate the Palestinians, when Bush is threatening Iraq and Iran 
with nuclear attack, when the American military forces are marching all over the 
world -- in Afghanistan, in the Philippines, in Georgia, in Colombia, and the 
CIA is all over the world, looking for "terrorists". 
<P>The world today is in a period of imperialism, the last stage of capitalism, 
where the US, the only superpower, is on a deadly mission to consolidate its 
rule over the world with the Iron Fist of its military might. 
<P>It is important to remember that if it weren't for this military might 
enforcing the economic interests of global capital, the multinational 
corporations would not be able to impose their never-satisfied thirst for 
greater profit on the people of the world. The WTO, World Bank, IMF and other 
such organizations are only financial tools which would have no force without 
the backing of the US military and its allies such as the NATO nations. 
<P>We are at a time of history when the global capitalist system is approaching 
its limit of capital accumulation. Production in the center countries is 
declining; they have moved their factories to the periphery where they can 
intensify the exploitation of labor and the environment and deplete the natural 
resources at an increasingly fast pace. 
<P>The geometric increase in world population coupled with the fact that the 
majority of the increase, in absolute and relative terms, is happening in the 
Third World, the decrease in the reserve of natural resources including water, 
and the deterioration of the environment, have intensified the competition for 
the available goods for consumption. 
<P>The assumption that with the magic of technology, the world would be able to 
produce almost limitless food and other goods for the increasing population, has 
been seriously questioned. Today we understand the fragility of the environment 
and the endangerment of life on this earth resulting from our indiscriminate use 
of the land, air and water. The application of technology and chemicals to the 
production of food and other goods creates tremendous problems for the world at 
large. 
<P>The rich countries can no longer expand their consumption (on the average the 
per capita consumption in the US is 200 times that of the average for the Third 
World), without severely decreasing what is available for the rest of the world. 
This is why we have seen the tremendous increase in the gap between the poor and 
the rich, both in the countries of the North and between the North and the 
South. (on March 19th, 2002, The Washington Post reports that in Zambia, $1.00 
feeds a family of 6 for one day.) 
<P>The fall of the Soviet Union in 1989 ushered the world into a new era. The 
capitalist powers believed or wanted the world to believe that the conflict 
between socialism and capitalism had ended in the victory of capitalism. Thus 
they announced the end of history. 
<P>In the 90's they celebrated the greatest expansion in their economies. But 
they only achieved this through telling the world that with the end of the 
historical conflict of capital and labor, and the victory of capital, it was 
safe for all to invest in their stock markets. Thus they fooled the middle class 
to buy into their pyramid scheme and hand over their savings and create the 
image of a ballooning economy. In fact it was nothing but a balloon which has 
already started to deflate. 
<P>At the time of deflation and economic depression, capitalist systems always 
turn to war to pump up the economy. So here we are. Bush and company announce a 
never-ending war on "terrorism". No one asks what happened to the big 
celebration of the end of history. Their propagandists, who were telling us how 
safe the capitalist system was, now tell us the "civilized world" (5) is in 
tremendous danger from the savages in the "uncivilized World". To defend 
themselves against these "savages", they send the CIA and the military to the 
Philippines and Georgia. Then they announce their intention to expand the war to 
include "rogue nations", particularly the "axis of evil": Iran, Iraq, and North 
Korea. 
<P>Why did Bush include Iran in his "Axis of Evil"? There are two important 
reasons: 
<OL>
  <LI>The geopolitical significance of Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia. 

  <LI>The ideological importance of the Iranian Revolution in the Islamic 
  movements around the world. </LI></OL>
<H3>The geopolitical significance of Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia. 
</H3>Iran is a geopolitically strategic country, located between Russia and the 
Persian Gulf which through the Strait of Hormuz connects to the Indian Ocean. 
Tsarist Russia had made numerous attempts at conquering or controlling Iran. 
With the entrance of the British colonialists on the scene, Iran became a point 
of contention between the Russians and the British. After the Russian 
Revolution, Iran's geopolitical importance increased due to the conflict between 
Western imperialism and the Soviet Union. Iran became an important front in this 
conflict. The long historical and cultural relationship between the people of 
Iran and the people of the Central Asian States of the Soviet Union, made Iran 
an easy area of influence for the Soviet Union. The 1953 CIA coup was a very 
significant victory in America's Cold War. This coup, which toppled the 
government of the nationalist prime- minister Mossadedgh and established the 
Shah back in power, was very important to the interest of US imperialism. It 
provided the US with a very strategic area of influence. 
<P>In addition, Iran had been an important route for trade from Central Asia to 
the rest of the world. Its importance in geopolitics became clear during the 
World War II, when the Allied forces occupied Iran in order to transport 
military aid to the Soviet Union in the war against Germany. 
<P>Today, with the fall of the Soviet Union, the close cultural and religious 
connection to the Central Asian republics increases the possibility of the 
expansion of the Iranian sphere of influence into Central Asia. 
<P>The discovery of <B>oil</B> in Iran and the rest of the Middle East 
tremendously increased the importance of Iran in the global economy and the 
strategy of the colonialists and the imperialist powers. 
<P>The discovery of oil reserves in the Caspian Sea region in the 1990's has 
increased the strategic importance of this area, especially Iran, for the US and 
the European Countries. The European Countries are completely dependent on the 
oil from the Middle East. The discovery of oil in the Caspian region opens a new 
source of energy for the energy-hungry countries of the North. The effect of 
this discovery for Iran is two-fold. It adds to the total oil reserves 
controlled by Iran. It also increases the economic importance of Iran as a 
transportation route for the Caspian oil. The experts consider Iran the most 
economically viable route for the pipelines to transport the oil and gas to 
Europe. However, in the absence of friendly relations with the US, other 
alternatives such as pipelines through Turkey are being considered. All of these 
have turned Central Asia into a very important element in the foreign policy of 
the US. Thus the concern of US with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmistan, 
Afghanestan, Georgia and Uzbekistan. The American oil interests have already 
purchased land in the areas. The American military has established bases in 
these republics in addition to its previous bases in Turkey and the total 
control of Afghanestan. <I>Thus Iran is encircled on all sides by American 
bases.</I> That is why Bush insists that after the problem of Iraq is solved 
they will give priority to Iran. 
<H3>The ideological importance of the Iranian Revolution in the Islamist 
movements around the world</H3>
<P>Why the tremendous propaganda and war against Islamist movements in the 
world? 
<P>During the cold war the policies of the imperialist powers included, on the 
one hand, brutal suppression of any leftist liberation movements in the third 
world (one example is the massacre of 30,000 communists in Indonesia); and on 
the other hand, the introduction of reforms such as the White Revolution in 
Iran, Green Revolution in India, Land Reform in South Vietnam and various 
welfare reforms in western Europe were introduced, in response to the struggle 
of the people for more rights. 
<P>While the imperialist powers and their domestic dictators (such as the Shah 
of Iran) were busy crushing the leftist movements, another form of opposition 
was gaining ground. In the case of countries with majority Moslem population, 
this alternative ideology was the ideology of Islam as a liberating force. (1) 
<P>The victory of the revolution in Iran (2) and the subsequent establishment of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) became an inspiration to Moslem people around 
the world and specially in the Middle East. (3) 
<P>This influence had the distinct effect of strengthening the Islamic forces 
such as Hamaas in Palestine, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Mujaheddin in 
Afghanistan, and the fundamentalists in Algeria, Egypt and Pakistan. In the 
ideological sphere, the Islamic forces reasoned that the left and the 
nationalist movements in the middle east had so far failed to defeat the US. The 
only real victory was that of the Islamic revolution in Iran. Later on, the IRI 
gave material support to some of these movements, especially in Bosnia. (4) 
<P>___________<BR>
<H2>Notes</H2>1 - The Islamic movements have played their parts alongside the 
nationalist and leftist forces in various liberation and anti-imperialist 
movements. The Algerian Liberation movement is a case in point. The movement of 
the Islamic Brotherhood, with a stronghold in Egypt, has also been politically 
active for a long time. The US, in its fierce fight against communist ideology 
and movements, saw these Islamic forces not as an enemy but as an ideological 
ally. 
<P>The Islamic movement in Iran, which eventually came under the leadership of 
Khomeini was opposed to the Shah's government from an anti-modern position and 
ideology. It was also strongly opposed to the left in Iran. By 1963, 10 years 
after the CIA's coup d'etat and its forming of SAVAK, the members of the Iranian 
Left had either gone into exile, been killed, or gone underground. Meanwhile, 
the Islamic forces had gained enough strength that the 1963 uprising was led by 
them and resulted in the exile of Khomeini to Iraq. 
<P>2 - There are oppositions to the use of "victory of revolution" from some 
leftist forces. They argue the revolution was defeated by the Islamic forces. 
The fact is that the revolution in Iran was a mass movement against US 
imperialism and its puppet the Shah. The revolution was successful in its main 
objectives. After the revolution, the Islamic forces consolidated their power 
and the nationalists and the leftist forces were defeated. 
<P>3 - Right after its establishment, The IRI announced its strong support for 
the rights of the Palestinian people; Arafat came for a visit. The IRI announced 
that it would end its export of oil to South Africa, and announced its support 
for many of the liberation movements. 
<P>4 - The US was alarmed with this new development, but not enough to not 
support the most fundamentalist of the Mojahedin in Afghanistan to fight the 
Soviet Union. 
<P>5 - In their news reports they write "the 17 civilized Nations that helped us 
in our war in Afghanistan". So the <I>1984</I> is complete. The warmongers are 
the civilized. Nations like Iran who are against the imperialist wars now 
masquerading as "war on terrorism" and yesterday as "war on Drugs", are the 
savages.</P>
