<h2>Main Point</h2>
<b>An effective peace and justice movement must justify its tactics based on reasoning about how to achieve stated and agreed social purposes.</b>
<h2>
Elaborations</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Be at the service of the movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tactics not a matter of personal or group taste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Rational discussion and debate about how to bring about goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tool: democratic coalition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We have no democratic coalition if one organization wants to dominate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lack of cooperation on tactics divides the limited resources of the movement and thereby makes it less effective.</p>
<li>
<p>An example of possible cooperation: There are at least three
 ongoing vigils in the DC area. If the sponsoring groups cooperate,
 everyone with the gumption to attend a vigil on a given week could show up at the same vigil. Each group sponsors one type of vigil (silence or not, message, location, etc.): so rotate the types.  <i>Results?</i> Interaction, discussion,
greater understanding, sharing of ideas, larger display of
feeling to impress the audiences.</p><li>
<p>
Movement should express core values (or points of unity).
<br>Examples (not exhaustive):</p><p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Rule of law (US must obey its Constitution and international law).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Self determination by people in their countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Respect for territorial integrity of countries.</p>
</li>
<li>Support all oppressed people in their struggle for
freedom. Belief in self determination means that every
liberation or resistance movement chooses its own
tactics.
The peace and justice movement is the USA is not
invited by the other people to evaluate their method
of struggle. A P&J movement can express support for
all movements without the need to state its support or
opposition to the specific method or tactic.
