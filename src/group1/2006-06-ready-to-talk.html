<h1>US ready to talk directly with Iran</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>The announcement on </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>May 31, 2006</span><span style='font-family:Arial'> by the
</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>US</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>
government that they are ready to talk directly to </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Iran</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>
represents the failure of the </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>US</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> attempt to isolate </span><span style='font-family:
  Arial'>Iran</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Washington</span><i><span style='font-family:Arial'>
Post</span></i><span style='font-family:Arial'> reported on June 1 that </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Germany</span><span style='font-family:Arial'> and
a growing number of foreign policy experts have been advising the White House
to deal with </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Iran</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> directly. </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>China</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'>, </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Russia</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> and the director of the IAEA have been asking for US
direct involvement for a while.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>During the more than two
years that Iran had voluntarily suspended its enrichment program and had
submitted to IAEA inspections at the Higher Protocol level, two of Irans
requirements were direct involvement of the US and discussion of Irans
security.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Now the </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>US</span><span style='font-family:Arial'> has
accepted the first condition.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the Chinese ambassador to the UN
has encouraged the Americans to consider a package of incentives for </span><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>Iran</span><span style='font-family:Arial'> which
includes security assurances for </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Iran</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> (</span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Washington</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> <i>Post</i></span><span style='font-family:Arial'>,
June 1) and has asked the </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>US</span><span
style='font-family:Arial'> to drop its requirement for suspension of uranium
enrichment as a precondition to the talks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>Various officials of the
Islamic Republic of Iran have stated that while they welcome this opening of
the door, they will not accept the suspension of any of their nuclear program
as a precondition to talks, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial'>It is difficult to believe
that </span><span style='font-family:Arial'>Iran</span><span style='font-family:
Arial'> may again agree to suspend enrichment prior to talks, except perhaps
with a time limit.&nbsp; If the White House is not genuinely ready for a real
negotiation, holding to the hard line Rice has expressed, there will be a
deadlock.</span></p>
