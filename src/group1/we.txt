WOULD YOU PLEASE DEFINE THIS "WE"? WERE YOU A PART OF
THE DECISION TO BOMB IRAQ AND OCCUPY IT? ARE YOU
SAYING THAT YOU STAND UNITED WITHE THE ACTIONS OF YOUR
GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD? IF NOT, IT WOULD LEAD TO A
MORE CLEAR DISCUSSION TO SAY THE US GOVERNMET'S
FOREIGN POLICY. I WILL REFER TO US GOVERNMENT TO
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE US, WHICH
DEFENDS THE INTEREST OF THE US CAPITALIST RULING
CLASS, FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOLE OF THE US. THE 5
PERCENT RULING CLASS WHICH OWNS MORE THAN 80% OF THE
WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY.

>made a serious foreign policy mistake

THE DECISION TO BOMB AND OCUPY AFGHANESTAN, IRAQ,
BUILD MILITARY BASES IN 156 COUNTRIES( ACCORDING TO US
DEFENCE DEPARTMENT), TRAIN KILLERS AND TORTURES IN THE
SAM, DECLARE IN THE WASHINGTON POST THAT THE US IS
PLANNING TO TRAIN PARA-MILITARY FORCES IN IRAQ, AND
COUNTLESS OTHER CRIMES OF THE US GOVERNMENT AGAINST
THE PEOLE OF THE THIRD WORLD IS NOT A "MISTAKE". THESE
ARE PLANED AND SYSTEMATIC ACTIONS OF THE IMPERIALISTIC
AND MILITARISTIC GOVERNMENT OF THE US WHICH HAS
INSTALLED COUNTLESS DICTATORSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD TO
CONTROL THE GENUINE AND DEMOCRATIC STRUGGLES OF THE
PEOLPE AGAINST THE ECONOMIC OR AND MILITARY OCCUPATION
OF THEIR COUNRIES. I RECOMMEND EVERYONE WHO IS
INTERESTED IN A PRINCIPLED DISCUSSION OF THE US POLICY
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, TO READ THE KISSINGER PLAN, WHERE
IT IS STATED THAT THE US MUST TAKE OVER THE OIL FIELDS
OF THE ME AND SEND EXPERTS FROM TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA TO
RUN THEM IN THE INTEREST OF THE US. THEN FOLLOW
THROUGH WITH EVERY PRESIDENTS NATIONAL SECURITY PRORAM
SINCE THEN, AND THE THE PROGRAM OF THE NEW AMERICAN
CENTURY AND LEARN THAT THIS IS NOT A POREIGN POLICY
MISTAKE BUT A PLANNED PROGRAM FOR HE DOMINATION OF THE
WORLD BY THE US GOVERNMENT AT ANY PRICE TO THE PEOPLE
OF THE WORLD.

WHY DISCUSS THE MOTIVATION OF A PERSON INSTEAD OF
DISCUSSING THE CONTENT OF THE ARTICLE? THIS KIND OF
PERSONAL ATTACK ON A PERSON FOR JUST SENDING AN
ATTACHMENT DOES NOT LEAD TO OPEN DIALOGUE.

>While restraining women and children is unfortunate,
IT IS NOT "UNFORTUNATE". FOR THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
WHO ARE RESTRAINED AS CRIMINALS IN THE INTERSET OF AN
ACCUPYING POWER, IT IS MONSROUS, IT IS A CRIME, IT IS
VIOLATION OF THEIR BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS ACCORDING TO THE
INTERNANATIONAL LAW. THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS WHO AHAVE
BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE OPRESSION OF A GOVERNMEN WHICH
WAS SUPPOSTED BY THE US GOVERNMENT WHEN IT WENT TO WAR
WITH THEI NEIGHBOR IRAN AND DRAGGED THEIR SUNS AND
FATHERS THEOUGH A CUMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE TO A AN
8 YEAR WAR AND THEN THE ATTACK ON IRAQ. THE US
GOVERNMENT AND ITS EUROPEAN ALLIES SUPPORTED SADDAM
HUSSEIN AND SOLD HIM THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS HE USED
AGAINST MY KURDISH BROTHERS AND SISTERS. NOW THE
AMERICAN MILITARY OCCUOIES IRAQ AND DETAINS ANRESTRICS
MY SISTERS AND THEI CHILDERN AND THAT IS UNFORTUNATE?
AN EARTHQUAKE IS UNFORTUANTE. THE ACTIONS OF THE US
GOVERNMENT IN IRAQ ARE INTERNATIONAL CRIMES AGAINST
HUMANITY.

SO WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF THE MIDDLE EAST ARE NOT HUMAN
BEINGS WITH HUMAN RIGHTS. THEY ARE JUST COLLATERAL
DAMAGE AND POSSIBLE CHESS PEACES.
These abuses pale in comparison with the actions of
the former Iraqi regime which employed "official
rape" and murder of children of opponents of Saddam.

ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO CERDIBLE AND DOCUMENTED
INFORMATION ON THESE CHARGES, I AM NOT COMCERNED ABOUT
THEM BECAUSE SADDAM HUSSEIN IS NOT MY CONCERN.
HE WAS NOT ELLECTED BY YOU, I OR THE PEOLE OF IRAQ.
HOWEVER YOU ARE SAYING THAT SINCE SADDAM HUSEIN DID
HORRIBLE CRIMES AGAINST THESE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IF
THE US MILITARY DOES THESE OTHER CRIMES IT IS OK SINCE
THE ALE IN COPARISON. SO IF SOMEONE RAPES AND KILLS
ONE OF MY CHILDREN, THE NEXT ONE COMES AROUND AND JUST
RAPES AND DOES NOT KILL, OR BLOODIES MY SECOND CHILD,
I SHULD BE THANKFUL TO THEIS SECOND CRIMINAL BECAUSE
HE IS NOT AS BAD AS THE DIRST CRIMINAL.
MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID,"MY COUNTRY, THE BIGGEST
PURVEYER OF VIOLENCE" IN 1967. THAT WAS BEFORE THE
CRIMES COMMITTED ALL OVER THE WORLD BY THE US
GOVERNMENT SINCE 1967.
YOU DID NOT ELLECT SADDAM HUSSEIN, BUT YOU ARE LIVING
IN A COUNTY WHERE YOU BELIEVE THEE IS REPRESENTATIVE
GOVERNMENT. YOUR TAXES ARE PAYING FOR THE CRIMES
COMMITTED IN IRAQ AND THE REST OF THE WORLD BY THE US
MILITARY.

AS I SAID I WAS NOT ABLE TO OPEN THE ATTACHMENT. I AM
A WOMAN OF THE MIDDLE EAST WHOSE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT
WAS OVERTHROWN BY A CIA COUP IN 1953. THE SECRET
POLICE SECURITY APPARATUS EASTABLISHED BY CIA AND
CALLED SAVAK IMPRISONED, TORTURED, MURDERED, RAPED MY
BROTHERS AND SISTERS FOR 25 YEARS.
YOUR ATATMENT HERE IS A CYNICAL AFFRONT TO THE PEOLRO
PF THE MIDDLE EAST ESPECIALLY THE SFFERING AND
COURAGEOUS WOMEN OF THE MIDDLE EAST. ONE OF US JUST
WONE THE NOBEL PEACE PRICE. SHE LIVES AND WORKS FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS AND CHILDRENS RIGHTS IN AN ISLAMIC COUNTY
WHICH HAS SIGNED THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE
RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. USA, ALONG WITH SOMALIA, ARETHE
ONLY TWO COUNTRIES WHICH ARE NOT SIGNATORY TO THAT
CONVENTION. THE US GOVERNMENT HAS NOT RATIFIED THE
COVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOME, AND IT HAS OPPOSED THE
WORLD COURT.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT AS A US CITIZEN YOU SHOULD TAKE
ON YOUR GOVERMNET?

THE PEOLE OF IRAQ AR NOT OCCUPYING THE US, THE US IS
OCCUPYING IRAQ. IF ANOTHER COUNTRY'S MILITARY SETS
FOOT HERE, IN THE GREAT USA? WOULD YOU RESIST THEM?
