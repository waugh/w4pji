article "OPEN LETTER TO U.S. REP. BARBARA LEE AND OTHER SUPPORTERS OF HR 4173", :depth => 1 do
  p "From the Ohio State Labor Party, April 23, 2012"
  p <<'!'
    Dear Congresswoman Lee:
!
  p <<'!'
    We wish to express our deepest admiration and respect for
    the vote you cast in 2001 against the  U.S. going to war
    with  Afghanistan.  Since you were the only legislator in
    either House of Congress to cast such a vote, it was indeed
    a rare act of courage. And to your credit, you continued
    taking a strong antiwar stance the following year when
    you voted against giving Bush authority to attack  Iraq.
!
  p <<'!'
    We are writing you now to express our dismay that you are
    the principal sponsor of HR 4173, a bill that contravenes
    the Iranian people's right to self-determination. We urge
    you to give consideration to the reasons stated below[,] which
    explain why we oppose the bill. But first a brief note on
    what we believe should be the strategy for preventing a
    U.S. war against Iran.
!
  p <<'!'
    The Ohio State Labor Party, together with a number of other
    antiwar formations, believes that the key to preventing
    a U.S. military attack against Iran is building a broad,
    massive, united, independent, international movement in
    the streets to support such basic demands as "No to War,
    No to Bombing, No to Sanctions Against Iran!"
!
  p <<'!'
    These demands are anchored on the fundamental respect for
    the right of peoples of other countries to settle their
    own destinies without outside dictation, intervention or
    occupation -- in short, their right to self-determination.
!
  p <<'!'
    The struggle for peace proceeds on several levels,
    including the legislative one. Here, we believe, the
    goal should be to win support of legislators for the
    antiwar movement's demands.  A classic example of
    this was the introduction of a resolution to Congress
    in 1971 by Sen. Vance Hartke of Indiana calling for the
    immediate withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Vietnam,
    with no conditions or qualifiers. Of course this followed
    the huge antiwar demonstrations that had been organized by
    the movement and the increasing public sentiment favoring
    immediate withdrawal.
!
  p <<'!'
    Regarding the situation we face today, we have learned
    to be wary of bills and resolutions [that] on their face
    appear to advance the struggle for a peaceful resolution
    of the U.S. government's confrontation with Iran, but,
    when scrutinized, leave the door wide open for U.S. and
    Israeli military attacks against that country. This,
    in our view, is the case with HR 4173.
!
  p <<'!'
    Let us explain the reasons we have reached this conclusion:
!
  h2 <<'!'
    1. President Obama's Announced Policy is to Conduct
    Diplomacy to Prevent Iran From Acquiring a Nuclear Weapon
    and Thus Avoid War; HR 4173's Stated Goal is to Conduct
    Diplomacy to Prevent Iran From Acquiring a Nuclear Weapon
    and Thus Avoid War.
!
  p <<'!'
    There is absolutely no daylight between the two. To be
    sure, President Obama says no options are off the table,
    including the military one, and he is not bluffing. HR 4173
    has language purporting to require Congressional approval
    before military action is taken against Iran (more on this
    below). But the intent of both is exactly the same.
!
  p <<'!'
    As you know, here is HR 4173's actual wording: "A Bill
    to direct the President of the United States to appoint
    a high-level United States representative or special
    envoy for Iran for the purpose of ensuring that the United
    States pursues all diplomatic avenues to prevent Iran from
    acquiring a nuclear weapon, to avoid a war with Iran, and
    other purposes." That is not only the title of the bill
    but it is repeated for emphasis in its first paragraph.
!
  h2 <<'!'
    2. National Sovereignty and the Right to
    Self-Determination
!
  p <<'!'
    If we in the antiwar movement are to remain true to our
    beliefs and program, we must recognize and respect Iran's
    right to defend itself as that nation sees fit. But
    this is violated by HR 4173. It is a gratuitous intrusion
    into Iran's internal affairs.
!
  h2 <<'!'
    3. Current Status of  Iran's Nuclear Program
!
  p <<'!'
    Iran today has no nuclear weapons, nor is there any evidence
    that it is building such weapons. In fact, both American
    and Israeli intelligence report that Iran has not yet
    decided to build a nuclear weapon. Iran's "Supreme
    Leader" has several times called for a "fatwa"
    condemning nuclear weapons.
!
  h2 <<'!'
    4. What's Wrong With Not Wanting  Iran to Have Nuclear
    Weapons?
!
  p <<'!'
    Absolutely nothing, so long as it's part of an agreement
    to ban such weapons arrived at by  Iran, Israel and the
    other states in the neighborhood, including those that have
    nuclear weapons. In absence of such an agreement, there
    is not even the pretense of even-handedness in singling
    out Iran. Instead it reflects a policy of lining up with
    Israel and the  U.S. government against Iran. Meanwhile,
    the ever more punitive and harsh sanctions against Iran
    continue to violate international law.
!
  h2 <<'!'
    5. Parallels With Iraq
!
  p <<'!'
    Not so long ago the  U.S. was threatening  Iraq with war
    if  Iraq did not agree to destroy its alleged weapons of
    mass destruction. Remember Condoleeza Rice's warning
    of mushroom clouds that ostensibly would poison us if
    Iraq were allowed to continue its build up of nuclear
    weapons unchecked?
!
  p <<'!'
    Of course, it was all a big lie. But as a consequence
    of the false and misleading claims of weapons of mass
    destruction, the U.S. engaged in a patently unjust war
    against Iraq, which led to the death of a million Iraqis
    -- including a half-million children -- and some 40,000
    U.S. casualties, along with the expenditure of a trillion
    dollars that could have been spent on urgently needed
    social programs.
!
  p <<'!'
    It's worth emphasizing that no one that we know of in
    the antiwar movement saw fit to call upon Iraq to give up
    its alleged weapons of mass destruction in order to avoid
    war. We were united in demanding no war against Iraq --
    period! -- and never felt compelled to get involved in its
    internal affairs. There is absolutely no justifiable reason
    for doing so now vis-a-vis Iran. With regard to Iraq,
    we said it was a war for oil and empire. The same would
    be true with a war against Iran.
!
  h2 <<'!'
    6. Experience of Other Countries
!
  p <<'!'
    Libya gave up its nuclear weapons program and the U.S.,
    together with its allies, proceeded to unleash a withering
    bombing attack against that country, resulting in the
    overthrow of the Libyan government. North Korea retains its
    nuclear program and has been spared such a military attack.
    Obviously, having nuclear weapons is a deterrent and if
    Iran decided to build them, it would be perfectly within
    its rights.
!
  h2 <<'!'
    7. Does HR 4173 Really Restrict the President From
    Taking Military Action Against Iran Without Congressional
    Approval? The Answer is NO!
!
  p <<'!'
    Support for HR 4173 cannot be justified by the claim
    that it includes language restricting the president's
    authority to conduct a military operation against Iran
    without "prior authorization by Congress, as required
    under article I, section 8, clause 2 [it's actually
    clause 11] of the United States Constitution, which grants
    Congress the sole authority to declare war.  "However, HR
    4173 undercuts this wording by listing three situations
    where such Congressional authority is NOT required,
    the third of which states: "This requirement shall not
    apply to a military operation or activity ... to directly
    thwart an imminent offensive military action to be launched
    from within the territory of Iran against United States
    forces or an ally with whom the United States has a mutual
    defense agreement."
!
  p <<'!'
    One would have to be naive in the extreme to rely on this
    language as a safeguard against unilateral presidential
    action. Based on the Iraqi experience, we must exercise
    the skepticism that is warranted and recognize that U.S.
    intelligence agencies are fully capable of concocting
    a situation where under HR 4173 the requirement for
    Congressional approval would effectively be waived.
!
  h2 <<'!'
    8. If There Is A U.S. War Against Iran, How Will It
    Be Justified?
!
  p <<'!'
    We should never forget that if the U.S. ends up bombing
    Iran, the justification will be, "We tried diplomacy to
    prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon but it did
    not work. They continued to enrich uranium and have been
    proceeding step-by-step to develop nuclear weapons. We made
    clear that we will not permit this to happen and the action
    we are taking now demonstrates that we mean what we say."
!
  p <<'!'
    In fact, HR 4173 actually opens the door for military
    action against Iran . After all, if the results of
    diplomacy fail to satisfy the U.S. government and Israel,
    then what's left other than invoking the military
    option? HR 4173 does not bar war against Iran; under
    certain circumstances it sanctions such a war even without
    Congressional approval!
!
  p <<'!'
    We strongly believe that that the people of this country
    must oppose a U.S. war against Iran, whether or not
    diplomacy succeeds or fails, and despite the measures Iran
    takes to defend itself.
!
  p <<'!'
    As the movement to prevent a U.S. war against  Iran
    continues to gather momentum, we can only hope that you
    will follow the example set by Sen. Hartke and introduce
    a new bill that explicitly endorses and incorporates the
    antiwar movement's demands, which in today's world means
    rejecting war, bombing and sanctions against Iran – a
    bill without loopholes or conditions. That would be a bill
    that the entire antiwar movement could enthusiastically
    embrace and promote.
