<P>Dear UFPJ’s
Leadership Group,</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><B>UFPJ has asked in
its Action Alert of 7/9/09 that people join the “United 4 Iran”
Global Day of Action on July 25.</B>  Is UFPJ confident that the
leaders and proponents of this action are not being financed by NED
and other “pro-democracy” fronts awash with some of the $400
million that the U.S. Congress has provided to the National Endowment
for Democracy, the CIA, the USAID - U.S. Agency for International
Development and others for the explicit purpose of subversion, acts
of sabotage, financing, equipping and training upper echelon
Iranian-Americans who are ready to serve the U.S. foreign policy
objectives of infiltrating and penetrating the security spheres of
the Iranian nation?  By supporting and attempting to create
credibility and prestige for these newly-hatched anti-Iran networks,
UFPJ’s legitimacy will be on the line, considering that NPR on July
10, 2009 reported that the majority of demonstrators in Washington,
DC were from the Mojahedin Khalq, a terrorist organization.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>In your July 9, 2009
Action Alert on Iran, you conveniently stated that, “What followed”
Iran’s presidential election on June 12 “remains unclear,”
which meant you had no lucid knowledge of the laws governing Iran’s
electoral process, the way the Tenth presidential election unfolded
and the events that took place during the four weeks after the
election.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Given this admission
one may ask what was the UFPJ leadership doing when during the first
two weeks after the election at least <I>50 thousand </I>articles and
news reports appeared in newspapers, magazines, TV and radio stations
and electronic sites in the United States and media around the world.
 It was truly one of the most written and talked about elections in
recent memory.  By asking UFPJ’s leadership some not so complicated
questions it may help the rest of us to separate the murky issues
from those that could be understood with statistical data and common
sense.  Unfortunately, in your Action Alert, you did not express
which issues you were clear about. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P><U><B>Questions that
UFPJ should answer:</B></U></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Was it honestly
	unclear to your group which candidate won the election?</P>
	<LI><P>Was it also
	unclear to your group that the U.S. administration openly tried its
	utmost to demonize the government of Ahmadinejad and blemish the
	authority and character of Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali
	Khamenei and conversely, by throwing doubt on the health of the
	election, it supported the defeated candidate, Mir Hossein Mousavi?</P>
	<LI><P>Was UFPJ’s group
	aware that the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, Vice
	President Joseph Biden along with quite a number of aggressively
	conservative U.S. House Representatives and Senators, including
	Lugar and John McCain, who called for “bomb, bomb, bomb” Iran
	had condemned the Iranian government for allegedly disregarding the
	“principles of human rights,” in the same manner that was a
	common practice of George W. Bush with regards to Iran and to Iraq
	before the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq and mass murdering
	the people of that country?</P>
	<LI><P>Is it honestly
	unclear to the leadership of UFPJ that the U.S. corporate media
	imbedded with the biggest shareholders of the electronic industries
	of Twitter and Facebook and in lockstep with the numerous
	intelligence services tried their utmost to incite greater riots and
	increase the odds for greater destruction of property and more
	bloodshed?</P>
	<LI><P>Was it unclear to
	the UFPJ leadership that British and U.S. intelligence services were
	busy days and nights, feeding the media frenzy around the world with
	touched up pictures and photo-shopped provocative images, with the
	aim of creating, deepening and expanding the crisis to other cities
	of Iran?  Was it really hard to imagine that the Western powers were
	aiming to destabilize Iran and as in the Ukraine and Georgia carry
	out their “color revolution”?  At least in Iran and this time,
	the U.S. and its allies were unsuccessful because a much greater
	majority refused to join a small minority whose leaders’
	objectives have been to throw Iran once again back into the arms of
	the U.S. and domestically make the rich richer and the poor poorer. 
	The U.S  – U.K – France governments have also been disappointed
	with their unsuccessful attempts in Zimbabwe, Sudan, Venezuela, and
	recently in Moldova. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Was the Board of
	the UFPJ aware that in the last few months many articles have
	appeared that explained the organizational and the constitutional
	framework of the Iranian election, and that many foreign news media
	were present before, during and after the election?  Did they know
	that the defeated presidential candidate Hossein Mousavi had 40,676
	representatives in the country’s polling centers all across Iran’s
	30 provinces?  Didn’t they read as others did that in every
	polling station there were at least 3 representatives from the
	Guardian Council, 3 from the Interior Ministry and 8 representatives
	from a total of four presidential candidates, which made a total of
	14 (more in the larger cities) poll watchers in each voting center?</P>
	<LI><P>Was
	UFPJ interested to know that in the span of the two years prior to
	the election on June 12, three statistical surveys were performed by
	a U.S.-based company named Terror Free Tomorrow, the Center for
	Public Opinion Poll?  In all those comprehensive surveys, the last
	of which was done May 11 to May 30, 2009, the findings just 13 days
	before the actual election, were that President Ahmadinejad hands up
	would win the election with a ratio greater than two to one!  The
	survey was done in Farsi from outside the country by an institution
	that serves BBC, ABC, and others.  The last study was published
	prominently and the head of the study interviewed on various news
	stations.  How could the leadership of UFPJ have missed this
	important information?  “While
	Western news reports from Tehran in the days leading up to the
	voting portrayed an Iranian public enthusiastic about Ahmadinejad's
	principal opponent, Mir Hossein Mousavi, our scientific sampling
	from across all 30 of Iran's provinces showed Ahmadinejad well
	ahead.”
	http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/14/AR2009061401757.html</P>
	<LI><P>Did the UFPJ Board
	know that Mousavi announced himself the winner 15 hours before the
	result was nationally announced by the Interior Ministry?  Did the
	Farsi-language speaking UFPJ’ers know that Mr. Mousavi had boasted
	in pre-election rallies and campaign literature long before the
	election that if he is not the winner of the June election, the
	election must be fraudulent and he will contest it?</P>
	<LI><P>Was the UFPJ
	leadership ignorant of another well-publicized news item that after
	Mousavi willfully declared the election fraudulent, the 12 members
	of the Guardian Council, the highest legislative body of the land,
	invited him to attend its meeting to present his documented
	grievances and his alleged irregularities? Doesn’t UFPJ leadership
	know that Mir Hossein Mousavi refused to attend and preferred to
	instigate his supporters by taking his case to the street, where the
	clashes between brick-throwing and fire-burning rioters on one hand
	and the civilian supporters of Ahmadinejad on the other resulted in
	the deaths of 20 persons, eight who were Iranian security officials?
	 Provocateurs, supporters of the monarchists from the Shah’s era,
	and some infiltrated terrorists from the anti-Islamic Mojahedin
	Khalq, for several days set fires, broke glass windows and doors of
	state owned properties and small shopkeepers, destroying private
	cars, city buses, and over 700 banks, but UFPJ claims to be ignorant
	of these facts, by proclaiming the demonstrators as “peaceful and
	carrying out their elementary right to protest their government”. 
	Now UFPJ is calling for those in the “peace and justice movement”
	to demonstrate against the Iranian government in the streets of NY
	on July 25<SUP>th</SUP>.  For the sake of comparison, many people
	must know that on June 14, the day after the election in Iran, a
	single bomb in Iraq killed 70 people instantaneously and injured 183
	persons.  But no U.S. media splashed this news on the front page of
	any mainstream media outlet or cared to discuss it on national TV
	programs, and <B>no peace and justice organization called an action
	to protest that violation of human and civil rights!  </B>Furthermore,
	no Iraqi citizen was invited to give his analysis about the
	insecurity and fatalities caused by the U.S. invasion and continued
	occupation of that country, albeit, when President Obama boastfully
	declared in Ghana the same week that the U.S. will not impose any
	social system on any country in the world.  What a colossal fib! 
	</P>
	<LI><P>We have another
	question for UFPJ: How would the New York Police force treat UFPJ
	members if they lit fires in the middle of Park Avenue, smashed
	buses, or attempted to put a police precinct on fire with fuel
	canisters? 
	</P>
</UL>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>What amazes us that
while by its own admission UFPJ states that they know very little
about all the complexities of the Iranian election, yet they are
asking us to take sides, thereby dividing the peace and justice
movement along one more sensitive and hot issue – Iran. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>As decision-makers in
the UFPJ, you wrote that you “feel compelled…to stand in
solidarity with the people of Iran and their elementary right to
protest their government…” The Iranian people do exercise their
right to peaceful assembly, as reported as recently as July 17, 2009
in the <I>Washington Post</I>, following Rafsanjani’s speech at
Friday prayers: “Shortly after the sermon, thousands of Mousavi
supporters demonstrated around Tehran University.”  As an Iranian
American dual citizen, and after spending two and a half months in
Iran from March to May, and being in Iran regularly over the past
four years, I find your assumption in this claim to be biased, either
by total ignorance of the social and political freedoms in Iran or
made out of the American cultural superiority concept that only
recognizes its own brand of ‘democracy’ as legitimate.  I can
attest that there are more opposing viewpoints appearing in more than
52 daily newspapers in Tehran alone than in the New York Times,
Washington Times and the Financial Times of London put together. 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Dear UFPJ’ers, today
your group politically, morally and ethically is standing on the same
platform that George W. Bush and the infamous neocons stood not long
ago when they called for “regime change” through bombing,
sanctions and attacking Iran. However, when it became clear that such
a military action had no support and was opposed around the world,
even by some of the elite Western governments who are helping the
U.S. military in Afghanistan and Iraq, they changed their tactic:
regime change with a soft touch, carried out by a segment of the
Iranian population that has been pro-western for longer than
Ahmadinejad has been in office.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Members of UFPJ who
have spoken openly against the Islamic Republic, and are supporting
the chants “Marg bar dictator!” of the protestors in northern
Tehran are objectively weakening the government in the Middle East
that has been the defendant and supporter of the people in Iraq,
Palestine and Lebanon.  Internationally, it was President Ahmadinejad
that strengthened Iran’s alliance with the people in Syria, Lebanon
and Palestine to resist the daily and yearly aggression of the
Zionist state.  It has been the government of Ahmadinejad who has
strengthened the Middle East peoples’ ties with Latin American
nations, specifically deepening ties with the governments of
Venezuela, Bolivia, Cuba, Brazil and with China, Russia, Malaysia,
and the 118 countries in the non-aligned nations, and built relations
with 53 Moslem countries. This is the government that our
western-oriented Iranian Americans are standing against, and who UFPJ
is giving a platform to.  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Do UFPJ members
	know that Mir Hossein Mousavi’s camp has been opposing the
	policies of President Ahmadinejad regarding Iran’s support for the
	Palestinian and other Arab people struggling against oppression?  Do
	they realize that Mousavi is against building relations with the
	socialist-oriented countries of China and Russia?  Perhaps UFPJ’s
	leadership has grievances with China and Russia also, and that makes
	it easier for them to align themselves with the anti-Ahmadinejad
	camp. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>I would like to end my
questions to the leadership of the United For Peace and Justice with
some quotes from President Ahmadinejad’s address to the Durban
Review Conference on Racism in Geneva on April 20, 2009, and ask them
to please let me know which part of this statement they believe
stands against peace and justice: 
<U><A HREF="http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=92046">http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=92046</A></U>
 
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>“Ladies and
gentlemen, let us take a look at the UN Security Council which is one
of the legacies of World War I and World War II. What was the logic
behind their granting themselves the veto right? How can such logic
comply with humanitarian or spiritual values? Would it not be
inconformity with the recognized principles of justice, equality
before the law, love and human dignity? Would it not be
discrimination, injustice, violations of human rights or humiliation
of the majority of nations and countries?  The council is the highest
decision-making world body for safeguarding international peace and
security. How can we expect the realization of justice and peace when
discrimination is legalized and the origin of the law is dominated by
coercion and force rather than by justice and the rights?</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Coercion and arrogance
is the origin of oppression and wars. Although today many proponents
of racism condemn racial discrimination in their words and their
slogans, a number of powerful countries have been authorized to
decide for other nations based on their own interests and at their
own discretion and they can easily violate all laws and humanitarian
values as they have done so. <BR><BR>Following World War II, they
resorted to military aggression to make an entire nation homeless
under the pretext of Jewish suffering and they sent migrants from
Europe, the United States and other parts of the world in order to
establish a totally racist government in occupied Palestine. And, in
fact, in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe,
they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist
regime in Palestine. <BR><BR>The Security Council helped stabilize
the occupying regime and supported it in the past 60 years giving
them a free hand to commit all sorts of atrocities. It is all the
more regrettable that a number of Western governments and the United
States have committed themselves to defending those racist
perpetrators of genocide while the awakened-conscience and
free-minded people of the world condemn aggression, brutalities and
the bombardment of civilians in Gaza. The supporters of Israel have
always been either supportive or silent against the crimes.”  
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Proponents of peace and
justice, again, I ask you to please tell me which statement of the
President of Iran stands against peace and justice?
