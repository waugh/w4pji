  coverage of the Iran elections in the US media is far
  from an objective news report and lacks any professional
  journalistic standards.

p <<-'!'
  There are two types of coverage: news reporting and news
  analysis, even though in this case they are mixed up the
  same way that these days in the US media, advertisement is
  mixed up with news and analysis, and most programs have
  become "infomercials".

h2 "News Reporting"
p <<-'!'
  Let's talk about the news.
!
p <<-'!'
  Although some news media had reporters on the ground,
  most pictures and quotes used came through YouTube, Twitter
  and such. These are not professional, substantiated
  news sources. Anybody, anywhere in the world can
  write whatever they want and proclaim it to be the
  truth or the facts. These types of unsubstantiated and
  subjective "reports" have replaced true professional news
  reporting. This is a general problem with media today
  expressed by professional journalists and journalism
  professors in many discussions. This becomes more of
  a danger to truth and reality when the topic is about
  a country far removed from America geographically,
  culturally, and politically, and where the official language
  is not English. Many "news" items referred to statements
  by Iranian officials without any mention of whether
  the reporter had the original Persian text, and
  whether there was a reliable and
  objective English translation available. The only language
  interpretations I have heard and trust are the ones by UN
  official interpreters at UN meetings.  Although sometimes
  there may be small errors, they are very small and not
  consequential. Otherwise, there have to be trustworthy
  translations. Some of the reporters were bilingual
  Iranians, but when I listened to the word by word debates
  in Persian and the Friday prayer speech by Khamenei, the
  Supreme Leader, I did not hear from those reporters any
  reference to exact translation of any of the words,
  nothing in the form "so and so said such and such"
  with the "such and such" in quotes.
  Even the "news" consisted of rephrasing
  of some portion of a long speech, out of context.
!
p <<-'!'
  One example is when Khamenei said, " . . .  if our young
  didn't have any hope they would not partake in the
  elections.  . . .  Faith in the system has been shown by
  the massive participation. . . . "
!
p <<-'!'
  Khamenei went on, " . . .  whoever has doubts can present
  proof through legal channels. I will not accept any illegal
  initiative. . . .  If today the laws are broken, no election
  will be immune in the future. . . .  If after every election
  those who have lost take to the streets and the winner's
  followers take to the streets [to fight it out], then why
  did we have elections?  . . .  People have been killed from the
  ordinary people and the Basidjis [volunteer reserve army]
  -- who is responsible?  . . .  Students were beaten up. . . .  My
  heart is hurt to see all this . . . "
!
p <<-'!'
  It was in this context that he called on the leaders of the
  opposition to take responsibility for preventing rioting
  under the cover of marches, and if they are not able to
  ensure the safety of the people, the police would stop
  all demonstrations.
!
p <<-'!'
  In one example in the Washington Post (July 27,2009),
  the heading says "cleric calls for ruthless punishment of
  protest leaders" with the word ruthless emphasized. In the
  article you read that one cleric is asking the Judiciary
  to "deal ruthlessly with the leaders of agitation which
  have connection to the US or Israel." This is one cleric's
  position, not necessarily the position of the leader of
  the judiciary. And it's not protest leaders in general,
  but those found to be responsible for the riots and
  destructions.
!
h2 "On The Analyses and Editorials"
p <<-'!'
  Now as to the analysis and editorials and opinion pieces:
!
p <<-'!'
  All of them come from one point of view. On TV programs,
  all talking heads are pro-Mousavi and his supporters. Every
  expatriate Iranian on TV and radio shows is pro-Mousavi.
  The shows do not invite one person, like me, who says they
  support Ahmadinejad's policies for Iran. Not only that,
  but they invite some Iranians to give their views who are
  not political activists or academicians with knowledge
  in politics, economics and so on: they invited Iranian
  expatriate movie stars and such who have been opposed to
  the Islamic Revolution and the Iranian government for 30
  years, similar to the anti-Castro Cubans in Florida. Every
  academician they talked to had hardline opposition to
  Ahmadinejad. They did not make an attempt to talk to one
  person at the polls here who voted for Ahmadinejad and
  ask her opinion. Whenever analysis and news on an issue
  is completely one-sided and the voice of the other side
  is absent, the coverage is suspect.
!
p <<-'!'
  The lack of objectivity becomes clearer when we see that
  for many days, news of elections of a relatively small
  country on the other side of the world becomes the dominant
  news on most TV, radio, and print media and the pictures of
  protesters become the cover of every news journal. CNN and
  Fox news become Iran news with uninterrupted coverage. One
  will have to ask why? The answer has been blowing in
  the wind for a long time. The context of this is the
  US continuous unfounded accusations against Iran.
  The context also includes the
  sanctions and boycotts, the inclusion of Iran in
  the "axis of evil" statement,
  and the threats of engineering regime
  change in Iran with or without military attack, with the
  allocation of budget in the US congress for the specific
  task of regime change in Iran. All of this because the US
  unabashedly states that control of Iran is in the national
  interest of the US.
!
h2 "Treatment of the Protesters"
p <<-'!'
  Now let's turn to the specific issue of treatment of
  protesters and the murder of Neda.
!
p <<-'!'
  As soon as the result of the election was announced, Mousavi
  and anther candidate who had received a few million votes
  called the election a fraud and called on their supporters
  to come out to the streets.
!
p <<-'!'
  Three hours after the closing of the polls, Mousavi had
  announced himself the winner. One prominent supporter
  of Mousavi, the wife of Rafsanjani (he heading the Assembly of
  Experts, which elects the supreme leader), when asked at the
  polling station what she thought, she said if we do not
  win, we will ask people to come out to protest.
!
p <<-'!'
  This was done without even attempting to file a formal
  complaint via legal means. In Iran, like America, there
  are channels for challenging election results.
  Such channels
  were used in the US by Gore and by many other candidates for
  Senate races and such. Mr. Mousavi, who was running as a
  candidate for the presidency of Iran and would have had to
  swear to uphold the constitution, completely bypassed any
  legal means and challenged the whole system of elections,
  while it was the system used in the prior election when
  Ahmdinejad, without the advantage of incumbency, had won.
!
p <<-'!'
  Mousavi's supporters came out in large numbers in Tehran (Iran
  is not only Tehran).  In many instances there were
  burnings of buses, breaking of windows of many shops (these
  are not Starbucks, but small businesses), breaking of windows
  of banks, attacks on and destruction of many personal cars,
  and many other acts of rioting.  There are pictures of
  these protesters/rioters carrying big sticks and huge
  stones. These un-permitted protests continued for one
  week with hardly any police presence. We all know that in
  the US one has to go through a relatively lengthy process
  of getting a permit and one is not given the permit
  one asks for. We see how the demonstrators are limited
  to certain areas many blocks away from the target and
  how the protests are lined with police, and since 9/11,
  with the government claiming special security concerns,
  it has become so much more difficult. In America a legal
  protest can not take place overnight.  When people come
  out in the street without a permit, they are automatically
  called rioters and everyone is arrested.
!
p <<-'!'
  It was only after one week and the speech of the
  Supreme Leader that called on the political leaders of
  the opposition to control the ongoing riots, which had
  already resulted in four deaths, that the police stopped the
  illegal protests and riots. This, even though if you see the
  videos taken by supporters of Mousavi, there are fewer
  and fewer protesters and they all are fighting the police
  and the Basidjis and increasing the level of violence. So
  far, eight Basidjis have been killed by the rioters. Can you
  imagine what the police in the US would do if one of them were
  killed in a protest?
!
p <<-'!'
  We know from experience that in the US, no protests without
  permit are allowed. If we decide to do civil disobedience,
  when the police come to arrest us, we peacefully submit
  to the arrest. If we choose to resist arrest, several
  riot police will come down on us with batons and beat
  us senseless and arrest us, and then we are charged with
  resisting arrest. All of this without our turning over buses
  and setting them on fire, making fire of the wreckage of
  motorcycles and other property we have destroyed, using
  the fire as a means of blocking police, throwing stones
  at the police from behind the fire, and so on.

h2 "On the Reporting of the Death of Ms. Neda"
p <<-'!'
With the report of the death of one young woman (Neda) in Iran
on the street during the protests, the American media jump on it
and assert that Neda was a protester and was killed by a
member of the security police.  All of this is asserted without
allowing for the completion of the government's investigation
into the crime scene, the bullet, and the other murder
evidence, and in the absence of any picture of the person
shooting at Neda.  In addition, there have been conflicting
reports as to how and where the shooting of Neda took place.
(Of course all these reports come via Twitter and Facebook
and such, none of them independently confirmed by reliable
news sources).
First it was reported that Neda was shot in a back alley
while running away from police, implying that she was one
of the protesters.  Members of her family later reported that
Neda was on a shopping trip, she got out of the car, and
she was shot.  The earlier reports said that she was shot
by a sniper from a rooftop.  Some reports said that she was
shot by someone on a motorcycle, and that the person on the
motorcycle was not in uniform.  So the opposition group
maintained
that the person on the motorcycle, though not uniformed, was
a government militia in plain clothes.  Considering that there
was no picture or video of the government security police
confronting the protesters in the location where Neda was
shot, and considering that there had been rioting and
rioters were also armed, although the majority of the protesters
were peaceful, it is as easy to speculate that Neda was shot
by a rioter as to speculate that she was shot by a
plainclothes government person.  And since she was not even
a protester, as tragic as her death is, why is she proclaimed
as the hero of a "movement"?  She was a victim, and since the
disruption in society begain with the rioters, which resulted
in the government bringing some riot police after one week of
demonstrations, it is difficult to say that she was a victim
of the government as opposed to a victim of the rioting.
!
p <<-'!'
At a time when the American media, when reporting on
torture and mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Graib
and "Gitmo", uses the word "alleged" even though there are
pictues taken by the interrogators themselves, and despite
the International Red Cross report that torture took place
in Guantanamo; but in the case of Iran, they report the murder
of Neda at the hand of Iranian security police as a fact.
This in spite of all the conflicting reports, the lack of
independent
confirmation, and when the forensic work in Iran was not
completed.
