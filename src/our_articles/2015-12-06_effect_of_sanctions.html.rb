I have mentioned in other talks and writings, the
Deal only covers the nuclear related sanctions on Iran.
Iran has been under increasing sanctions and boycotts since
its revolution.  The first sanctions were military at the
beginning of the revolution, while Iraq with total military
support by the west attacked Iran. Since Iran's military
arsenal from the time of the shah were American, Iran could
not get even parts, let alone, new arsenal.  However, with
the revolutionary spirit, the Iranians reverse engineered
or invented new ways to provide the military arsenal for
the war against Saddam's aggression with all the might of
US behind it including chemical weapons used against Iran's
army. So, Iran was capable of defeating this aggression
just one year after revolution and under military boycott.
One reason, in addition to the revolutionary determination
and creativity, was that Iran is not  a poor country due to
its abundant oil.  In fact the Iran-Contra affair belongs
to that period where the colnol North and anti Nicaragua
forces in US, conspired to sell arms to Iran(in violation
of US embargo) so that they could use the revenue from
the sale in their contra activities in Nicaragua.( so much
for lack of conspiracy in US international intrigue).

US continuously increased sanctions against Iran based on
various false claims. Iran was declared a State sponsor
of terrorism because of its defense of the Palestinian
and Lebanese resistance forces. This state- ponsorship of
terrorism of Iran has not been lifted in the Deal either.

Then in 2002, when Iran in the reconstruction after
the 8-year war decided to restart its nuclear industry,
it gave the US the best excuse and for 12 years it kept
piling on the sanctions. Even during the government of
Khatami( 1997-2005), when he unilaterally stopped uranium
enrichment, US not only refused to lift any sanctions but
kept increasing them.  While US claimed it was concerned
about Iran's enrichment, it really was using the false
issue to bring Iran under its sphere of control. So,
just stopping the enrichment was not enough recuse Iran
said it would not negotiate anything else with any other
ore-conditions.  The US wanted other advantages like the
one we see in the new deal. for example, at the time,
Iran was not accepting inspection of its military sites,
and so on.  When Ahmadi nejad was elected in 2005, the
government took a hard anti-imperialist position towards
US. Iran said since for 2 years of enrichment  stoppage,
US had increased its belligerence, Iran was going to reopen
its enrichment program and expand it so it would become
nuclear industry independent.  In addition Iran went on
to develop strong relationship with all Latin American
anti imperialist forces such as cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia
and.. and strengthened its relationship with Lebanon,
Syria and Palestine.  In response to US efforts to isolate
Iran economically, Ahmadi Nejad's government developed
its ties with all non European countries and Russia. iran
was not economically isolated.  In fact, to my chagrin,
you could fine anything in Iran, including rel Gucci backs
and glasses( My daughter's sun glass broke while in Iran
and we went to a boutique near my brother's house and
were amazed at all the western designee glasses that we
could not afford).  The people of lower economic classes
do not buy western consumer goods anyway.  because of the
international market of global capitalism, big corporations
have international ways of selling things anywhere. You
could even buy Pepsi cola in Iran.  lower economic classes
are affected by prices of basic goods. The biggest blow
was after the victory of Ahmadi Nejad in 2009. Then US was
determined to increase the pressure and turn people against
the government. So, the US9with the help of UN ) imposed
banking restrictions on Iran. This meant that because of
lack of Internationale banking access, Iran was not able to
obtain letters of credit which is a must in international
trade, and the value of its currency dropped right away
by 200%. This made imports more expensive, but since then
I traveled to Iran many times and there was never any
shortage of basic food or luxury.  In response to this
the government increased subsidies to the poor and bread
subsidies( these were reduced or eliminated by the current
government). The government also increased the minimum
wage and the government employees pay and the pensioners.
The criticism of the opposition was that this increases
the inflation(just as neoliberals everywhere say about
aid to the poor). But the terrible inflation was to a
large extent due to international banking sanctions.
So, there was some effect but there were no shortages
and since a large % of Iranians work in the government,
the increase in government pay is very helpful.

Benefits of the sanctions: since Iran has oil revenue and
highly educated populace, under 30 years of sanctions it
has become more self sufficient in many areas.
!

The most important benefit has occurred in the
pharmaceutical industry. Every medicine(other than the
most experimental ones being developed in the west)
is produced in Iran generically and cheaply. the drug
prices are highly controlled and subsidized. As a result
drugs are very cheap in Iran. The first time I went to buy
something I was shocked because a tube of the medicine was
less than 50 cents. So, many Iranians when traveling to
Iran buy up to three months of all their medications and
bring it here. We did the same for my Mother and I refilled
some of my prescriptions there. I am afraid that with the
opening of the doors to western companies this important
achievement will be at risk.  Along die the pharmaceutical
industry, health services have also developed and people
from various middle eastern countries, especially Iraq
and Afghanistan where their health system is in tatters,
come to Iran for surgeries.
!

p <<-'!'
Even though Iranians with money drive Japanese, Korean
and German cars, but due to sanctions Iranian automobile
industry expanded and Iran exports cars in the middle
east. Again the opening of doors will endanger this
industry as well.
!

This kind of development has been true for many small
manufacturing business, those which build metal oil
containers, and such.
!

p <<-'!'
Iran's ceramic industry especially factories located in
Yazd( When I visited Yazd about 4 years ago there was
almost full employment there. Since it is a small city
near the desert, the land is cheap to build factories and
as a result housing is cheap, so it is a good place for
factory workers.)have expanded and Iran is big exporter
of ceramics both for housing construction and home goods.
!

Since Iran's market. like everywhere else has been open
to china, all manners of consumer goods at low prices,
made in china, are available in Iran. So, textile induxtry
like most countries in Africa has not been revived.
!

p <<-'!'
Since the poor when buying foreign made products, buy
Chinese, they were not affected as much. After the banking
sanctions, Iran and China did contracts in barter. Iranians
complained because they said we gave then gas and they gave
us junk goods. Then I asked them why they bough Chinese,
instead of Iranian, and they said because Chinese was
cheaper. Same story here in US.
!

p <<-'!'
Since Iran produces lots of fruits and vegetables, it
exports those to the gulf countries where they are deserts
and import all produce.
!

p <<-'!'
Another benefit from my point of view was that the banking
sanctions made it somewhat more difficult for the 1%
to take all the money they teal from Iran, to foreign
countries. It simply became more expensive in terms if
exchange and the extra bribes they had to pay in the black
international king market to transfect all their stolen
wealth to outside Iran.
!

p <<-'!'
Even in areas of government contracts for building of
railroads and subways and such big public works, Iranian
small contractors have been doing it( I have very close
family involved both in small industrial business and
public work contracts for subways and such), with the
opening of borders to foreign companies which I suspect,
under the pretense of helping Iran, will demand credits
from Iran's government, these iranian small industrial
shops and engineering contractors  will lose out and
foreign engineers and managers will take lucrative pays
and displace the Iranians. This is what always happens when
countries of the global south open their borders to foreign
"investment". Remember Arbantina and Greece.
!

p <<-'!'
So, Iran is not an isolated, desperate and Hungary. It
did not have to give up its nuclear energy rights and
its military independence to get a promise of US to lift
some sanctions after Iran has destroyed million dollars
of nuclear industry capital investments( bulldozing the
constructions) and has bent over backward to satisfy the
most sever demands by US. And still be on probation under
the threat of military attack.
