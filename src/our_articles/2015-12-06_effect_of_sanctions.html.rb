I have mentioned in other talks and writings, the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or "Iran nuclear deal"
as people call it (simply the "Deal" hereinafter)
only covers the nuclear-related sanctions on Iran.
Iran has been under increasing sanctions and boycotts since
its revolution.  The first sanctions were military
since the 1979 revolution. Then Iraq, with total military
support by the West, attacked Iran. Since Iran's military
arsenal from the time of the Shah was American, Iran could
not get even parts, let alone, new arsenal.  However, with
the revolutionary spirit, the Iranians reverse engineered
or invented new ways to provide the military arsenal for
the war against Saddam's aggression with all the might of
the
US behind it including chemical weapons used against Iran's
army. So, Iran was capable of defeating this aggression
just one year after revolution and under military boycott.
One reason, in addition to the revolutionary determination
and creativity, was that Iran is not  a poor country, due to
its abundant oil.  In fact the Iran-Contra affair belongs
to that period where the Colonel North and anti-Nicaragua
forces in the US conspired to sell arms to Iran (in violation
of a US embargo) so that they could use the revenue from
the sale in their contra activities in Nicaragua (so much
for lack of conspiracy in US international intrigue).

The US continuously increased sanctions against Iran based on
various false claims. Iran was declared a state sponsor
of terrorism because of its defense of the Palestinian
and Lebanese resistance forces.
This designation of Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism
has not been lifted in the Deal either.

In 2002, as a part of the reconstruction subsequent to the eight-year
war, Iran decided to restart its nuclear industry. This provided the US
with a pretext for a whole new set of sanctions and embargoes against Iran.

The US asserted that enrichment was a key problem, yet even after the
Khatami government suspended enrichment for two years,
the US not only continued sanctions but added to them.
!

p <<-'!'
When Ahmadinejad was elected in 2005, the
government took a hard anti-imperialist position towards the
US. Iran said that since for 2 years of enrichment  stoppage, the
US had increased its belligerence, Iran was going to reopen
its enrichment program and expand it so it would become
nuclear industry independent.  In addition Iran went on
to develop strong relationships with all Latin American
anti-imperialist forces such as Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia,
and strengthened its relationships with Lebanon,
Syria and Palestine.  In response to US efforts to isolate
Iran economically, Ahmadinejad's government developed
its ties with all non-European countries and with Russia. Iran
was not economically isolated.  In fact, to my chagrin,
you could find anything in Iran, including real Gucci bags
and glasses (my daughter's sunglasses broke while we were in Iran
and we went to a boutique near my brother's house and
were amazed at all the western-designed glasses that we
could not afford).  The people of lower economic classes
do not buy western consumer goods anyway.  Because of the
international market of global capitalism, big corporations
have international ways of selling things anywhere. You
could even buy Pepsi cola in Iran.  Lower economic classes
are affected by prices of basic goods. The biggest blow
was after the victory of Ahmadinejad in 2009. Then the US was
determined to increase the pressure and turn people against
the government. So, the US (with the help of the UN) imposed
banking restrictions on Iran. This meant that because of
lack of international banking access, Iran was not able to
obtain letters of credit, which is a must in international
trade, and the exchange rate of its currency dropped right away
to 1/3 of what it had been.
This made imports more expensive, but since then
I traveled to Iran many times and there was never any
shortage of basic food or luxury.  In response to
the price increases,
the government increased subsidies to the poor and bread
subsidies (these have since been reduced or eliminated by the current
government). The government also increased the minimum
wage, the government employees' pay, and pensions.
The criticism from the opposition was that this increases
inflation (just as neoliberals everywhere say about
aid to the poor). But the terrible inflation was to a
large extent due to international banking sanctions.
So, there was some effect but there were no shortages
and since a large proportion of Iranians work in the government,
the increase in government pay was very helpful.

h2 "Benefits of the Sanctions" # This makes this phrase a header.

Since Iran has oil revenue and a
highly educated populace, under 30 years of sanctions it
has become more self sufficient in many areas.

The most important benefit has occurred in the
pharmaceutical industry. Every medicine (other than the
most experimental ones being developed in the West)
is produced in Iran generically and cheaply. The drug
prices are highly controlled and subsidized. As a result,
drugs are very cheap in Iran. The first time I went to buy
something I was shocked because a tube of the medicine was
less than 50 cents. So, many Iranians when traveling to
Iran buy up to three months of all their medications and
bring it here. We did the same for my mother, and I refilled
some of my prescriptions there. I am afraid that with the
opening of the doors to western companies, this important
achievement will be at risk.  Along with the pharmaceutical
industry, health services have also developed and people
from various middle eastern countries, especially Iraq
and Afghanistan where their health system is in tatters,
come to Iran for surgeries.
!

p <<-'!'
Even though Iranians with money drive Japanese, Korean
and German cars, due to the sanctions the Iranian automobile
industry expanded and Iran exports cars in the middle
east. Again the opening of doors will endanger this
industry as well.
!

p <<-'!'
This kind of development has been true for many small
manufacturing businesses, those that build metal oil
containers, and such.
!

p <<-'!'
Iran's ceramic industry, especially factories located in
Yazd, have expanded and Iran is a big exporter
of ceramics both for housing construction and for home goods.
(When I visited Yazd about 4 years ago there was
almost full employment there. Since it is a small city
near the desert, the land is cheap to build factories on and
as a result housing is cheap, so it is a good place for
factory workers.)
!

p <<-'!'
Since Iran's market, like everywhere else, has been open
to China, all manners of consumer goods at low prices,
made in China, are available in Iran. So, the textile industry
has not been revived in Iran (just as it also has not been revived
in most countries in Africa).
!

p <<-'!'
Since the poor when buying foreign-made products, buy
Chinese, they were not affected as much. After the banking
sanctions, Iran and China did contracts in barter. Iranians
complained because they said we gave then gas and they gave
us junk goods. Then I asked them why they bought Chinese,
instead of Iranian, and they said because Chinese was
cheaper. Same story here in the US.
!

p <<-'!'
Since Iran produces lots of fruits and vegetables, it
exports those to the gulf countries that are essentially deserts
and import all produce.
!

p <<-'!'
Another benefit from my point of view was that the banking
sanctions made it somewhat more difficult for the 1%
to take all the money they steal from Iran, to foreign
countries. It simply became more expensive in terms if
exchange and the extra bribes they had to pay in the
international black market to transfer all their stolen
wealth out of Iran.
!

p <<-'!'
Even in areas of government contracts for building of
railroads and subways and such big public works, Iranian
small contractors have been doing it (I have very close
family involved both in small industrial business and
public-works contracts for subways and such), with the
opening of borders to foreign companies which I suspect,
under the pretense of helping Iran, will demand credits
from Iran's government, these Iranian small industrial
shops and engineering contractors  shall lose out and
foreign engineers and managers will take lucrative pay
and displace the Iranians. This is what always happens when
countries of the the global south open their borders to foreign
"investment". Remember Argentina and Greece.
!

p <<-'!'
So, Iran is not isolated, desperate and hungry. It
did not have to give up its nuclear-energy rights and
its military independence to get a promise from the US to lift
some sanctions after Iran has destroyed millions of dollars
of nuclear-industry capital investments (bulldozing the
constructions) and has bent over backward to satisfy the
most severe demands by the US, and still be on probation under
the threat of military attack.
