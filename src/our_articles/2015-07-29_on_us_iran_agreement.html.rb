    US-Iran nuclear agreement is a victory for US imperialism and a danger to the Iranian nation and people.
!
  end

  p <<-'!'
   This agreement affords the US its demand of limiting
Iran’s nuclear-energy program and imposing draconian
restrictions on Iran’s independence and territorial
integrity. The only apparent advantage to Iran from
the agreement would be the lifting of the sanctions;
however, such lifting only figures in the agreement as
a promise to be implemented in the future.  While the
process of lifting of sanctions by the Europeans is in
the agreement, the lifting of the US embargo is not even
addressed. Moreover, according to the US administration,
removal of any sanctions is accompanied by a provision
that will allow the sanctions to snap back into place as
soon as a problem is perceived with Iran's compliance with
any of the many intricate requirements.
!

  p <<-'!'
The requirements detailed in this agreement go way above
and beyond the regular and additional protocols of the
IAEA, taking away Iran's international rights afforded
to all NPT signatory countries.  In addition, Iran
has agreed to the inspection of any site including its
military sites. Since the agreement contains no sunset,
Iran has committed itself to this intervention in its
sovereignty forever.
!

  p <<-'!'
Prior to this agreement, even during the
additional-protocol inspections, the IAEA reported no
material evidence of cheating by Iran. Nevertheless,
the US expressed suspicions that Iran was cheating in
order to sell the public on measures and threats against
Iran. This new agreement makes a whole new category of
obligations that the ruling class can accuse Iran of
violating. Consequently we have every reason to expect
them to use such pretexts for more serious threats and
possibly actual military attack.
!

  p <<-'!'
This agreement began covertly in March of 2013
with Nicholas Burns, former Undersecretary of
State for Political Affairs, acting as the undercover
negotiator, with the Party of Moderation and Development (
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation_and_Development_Party
), whose leader, Rouhani, was expected to be the
incoming president. Consequently upon the beginning of
his presidency, his government, unilaterally suspended
uranium enrichment, as the Khatami government had done
for two years.  In addition, Rouhani's government began
implementing many neoliberal policies by reducing or
eliminating many welfare programs, such as bread subsidies,
to the lower-income families, and reducing free services,
such as daycare centers for children with disabilities
such as Down syndrome.
!

  p <<-'!'
    Rouhani represents the pro-global-capital, neoliberal
class in Iran. From the beginning of the victory of the
1979 revolution, while the US used every tool, including
the Saddam Hussein war on Iran, for regime change from
without, it tried to find allies in the class struggle
in Iran. The 1979 revolution was an anti-US-imperialism
revolution that included the Islamists, the nationalists,
and the socialist/communists. The Islamist forces, who had
been the majority, eventually eliminated the others from
the power structure. But within the Islamist forces, the
class struggle has continued between the revolutionary,
anti-imperialist, pro-working class forces (who wanted
a welfare state independent of imperialist forces), and
the wealthy classes (who preferred a more western type
capitalist economy). Via the victory of Khatami in 1997,
the pro-western, anti-welfare, neoliberal forces came to
power. The Khatami government began the appeasement of the
US, and in order to attract more investment, it forgave
the monarchists, many of whom had fled Iran, and invited
them to come back. Many went back and reclaimed lands
that had been confiscated in the revolution. Despite all
the overture, the US continued its sanctions and hostile
rhetoric against Iran. This was due to the fact that
the revolutionary forces were quite strong and required
US confirmation of the Algiers agreement signed by the
Carter Administration as part of any negotiation. The first
provision of the Algiers agreement is, “The United States
pledges that it is and from now on will be the policy of
the United States not to intervene, directly or indirectly,
politically or militarily, in Iran’s internal affairs.”
The US would not agree to that because its strategic goal
is the control of Iran for its geopolitical importance
and oil and gas resources.
!

  p <<'!'
    In furtherance of that goal, in 2002 the US began a
new attack on Iran by accusing it of trying to develop
nuclear weapons. Iran had signed the NPT in the 1970’s
and had begun building a nuclear-energy program. It was
in 2002 that the Iranian government decided to restart
that program according to NPT regulations. However, the US
said that Iran was cheating, and their first source of the
information of this alleged cheating was reported to be the
MKO. Somehow, the IAEA had not found any problem, but an
exiled organization living in an enclosed camp in Iraq was
successful in discovering problems with Iran’s nuclear
program. This lie was accepted in the west even after the
US lie about chemical weapons in Iraq had been exposed.
!

  p <<-'!'
    Again, to appease the US, the Khatami government
unilaterally suspended uranium enrichment in 2003,
hoping for an agreement with the US for lifting of
sanctions. However, in any preliminary discussions
conducted by other nations as intermediaries, Iran demanded
the non-intervention condition, and the US refused to
begin direct discussions with Iran.
!

  p <<-'!'
    With the US increasing its sanctions despite Iran’s
suspension of enrichment, the revolutionary forces won the
election in 2005, electing Ahmadinejad as president. His
government expanded many existing welfare programs and
implemented new ones, such as massive affordable housing
for the poor. This government also raised the slogan of
nuclear energy as an international right and restarted
the enrichment program. He also expanded international
relations with independent and/or socialist countries,
especially Cuba and Venezuela. His government reaffirmed
Iran’s commitment to support liberation struggles
in the Mideast, especially Hamas and Hezbollah in
Lebanon. All of these domestic and international
actions were considered hostile by the US, which
increased sanctions and anti-Iran propaganda. The US also
increased its support for the neoliberal forces in Iran
and attracted many of the educated upper-middle-class
youth through”pro-democracy” slogans and financial
and training support. These people were in the same
class as the ones recruited in color revolutions in
various countries. So, in the 2009 election, the class
struggle was represented as between, on the one hand, a
pro-Ahmadinejad faction (mostly poor working-class from
outside Tehran), and on the other hand, a pro-Mousavi
faction or the Greens, mostly urban upper-class youth and
the neoliberal capitalists (the symbolism of the green
color being interpreted in this social context as the
color of Islam, not the environment).
!

  p <<-'!'
This movement was clearly pro-Imperialist, since the
slogans included death to China and death to Russia and
no more money for Palestine. This was the first time
in Iranian history where anti-Palestine slogans had
appeared. While Russia and China had nothing to do with
the Iranian elections, the US was extremely involved
in promoting the Greens and condemning Ahmadinejad’s
government. The US was hoping for a win by Moussavi,
and Obama promised to begin talks with Iran after
elections. When the Greens lost, the US attacks on Iran
increased and the elections were called invalid.
!

  p <<-'!'
The US kept increasing sanctions on Iran and threatening
Iran with military attack while expanding its support for
the neoliberal forces in Iran. During the eight years of
Ahmadinejad’s government, the class struggle in Iran had
intensified. The majority of the members of the parliament
were anti-Ahmadinejad forces, especially the neoliberals.
With the increasing US sanctions and financial attacks
on Iran and embargo of Iranian oil, and the US covert
support for the neoliberals, the anti-imperialist and
populist government of Ahmadinejad came under political
attack. The neoliberals, who wanted appeasement of the US
in order to attract international investment to Iran, had
gained such power that no presidential candidate from the
anti-imperialist and populist forces was certified to run.
!

  p <<-'!'
This is the context in which ambassador Burns was
sent to begin talks with the almost assured incoming
president, and the US was assured of suspension of uranium
enrichment, giving up of the previous Iranian demands,
and implementation of neoliberal policies.
!

  p <<-'!'
This is that reason that Obama decided to have a direct
talk with Iran for the first time. It was not a talk
between equals, but the master and the servant.
!

  p <<-'!'
The agreement creates many detailed obligations on
Iran. The perceived failing of Iran in any detail will
provide the US with a pretext to snap back the sanctions
and attack Iran. During the whole process of these talks
and subsequent to the signing of the agreement, the US
government has maintained that the military option is
on the table. So, Iran is still considered by US as “a
supporter of terrorism”, and Iran is still under threat
of military attack by the US. This agreement provides
extended opportunities, excuses and pretexts for the US
to attack Iran militarily  without resort to any new UN
resolutions where the US might face opposition by Russia
and China. Now, Iran has agreed to be directly responsible
to the US under the draconian measures of this agreement.!

  p <<-'!'
What is the basis of US hostility to Iran? It stems from
Iran’s nationalization of its oil. The US responded with
the infamous CIA coup of 1953, which brought Iran under
US influence. The 1979 revolution overthrew the Shah and
the US influence and interference in Iran. Ever since
1979, the US has used every excuse and attempted every
trick to change the regime in Iran either through revolt,
threat of military attack or subversion of the current
system to the will of the US and its supporters in Iran
(the pro-globalization, capitalist class).
!

  p <<-'!'
Iran has never threatened to attack the US or its
“interest”. In fact, during the war on Afghanistan,
Iran declared neutrality. Al-Qaida and the Taliban were
and are determined enemies of Iran.  Although Iran was
opposed to US military occupation of Iraq, it has supported
the government established by the US in Iraq. On the other
hand, the most important ally of the US in the Middle East
(after Israel) is Saudi Arabia, the founder and supporter
of Al-Qaida, ISIS, and the Taliban.
!

  p <<-'!'
So, considering that this agreement does not change any
US policies or strategic goals toward Iran, what are the
possible outcomes for the Iranian people?
!

  p <<-'!'
1- Increased probability of various degrees of military
intervention by the US for the reasons explained
above. This is coupled with increased vulnerability of
Iran’s defense due to the comprise of its military
secrets via IAEA inspections.!

  p <<-'!'
This increase in the probability of war is against the
interests of the American and Iranian people.
!

  p <<-'!'
2- Increased probability of covert US operations in Iran
resulting in revolts and chaos as is happening in many
Arab and/or Islamic countries where the US has had access
to do so. The opening of Iran to the US as a result of
this agreement will make it easier for the US to support
“pro-democracy” (neoliberal and pro-US) factions.
!

  p <<-'!'
3- Decrease in actual support by Iran for liberation
movements in Palestine, Lebanon, Yemen, and military
and political support for the governments of Syria and
Iraq. Under the current political atmosphere where
the power struggle between revolutionary forces and
the pro-west neoliberals has not ended in complete
victory for the latter, this outcome, which is one of
the main objectives of the US, cannot be easily and
openly implemented. The possibility of this outcome
increases gradually as the revolutionary, nationalist and
anti-Imperialist forces in Iran lose power.
!

  p <<-'!'
4- Weakening of Iran’s trade and political alliances
with the ALBA countries, Russia, and other non-aligned
countries in the world. This outcome will become more
probable as Iran expands its relations with the West.
!

  p <<-'!'
5- More reduction in welfare and social programs for the
poor and working people to attract global capital. The
neoliberal forces in Iran, who are in control of the
Administration, the Parliament and the Judiciary at this
time, have already begun the process to achieve this
outcome as a prerequisite for the Agreement.
