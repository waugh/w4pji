    Iranian scientist has been assassinated inside Iran.
    This is the fifth Iranian scientist assassinated in
    Iran during the past two years. This is an indication of the escalation
    of the covert activities conducted by the CIA and Israeli intelligence
    and their domestic spies in Iran against the government and people
    of Iran.

    US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated, "I want to categorically
    deny any United States involvement in any kind of act of violence
    inside Iran." However, both the Israeli and the American governments
    have admitted to covert activity in Iran. Irrespectively of the actors,
    the assassination of law abiding scientists living and working in Iran
    is a reprehensible act that should be condemned by all.

    The fact is that the governments of the US and Israel have declared Iran as
    their enemy and have publically stated that they will use all means
    possible, up to military attack, to stop the nuclear energy production
    in Iran and to change the government of Iran. To this end they have
    admitted to:

    The assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists falls within the
    covert activities in disrupting nuclear energy production in Iran. In
    addition, it works to create an atmosphere of fear among regular Iranian
    scientists who want to work in their field of study.  However, the
    people of Iran have repeatedly stated their resolve to defend their
    right to nuclear energy. The mother of Mr. Ahmadi Roshan,
    the 32-year-old scientist, has
    stated that she is proud of the work of her son in the service of his
    country and she has urged all young Iranian scientists, especially the
    nuclear-energy scientists, to continue serving their country to achieve
    success and advancement.

    Considering that Hillary Clinton threatened Iran with military attack,
    it is disingenuous for her to state that the US denies involvement in any
    violence within Iran. A military attack on Iran, especially an attack on
    Iran's nuclear energy facilities, which will produce results similar
    to a nuclear attack (US Concerned Scientists report), will be the
    most violent act against the people of Iran and will result in hundreds of
    thousands of civilian deaths.

    All the actions listed above sanctioned by the US government are
    directed at weakening the Iranian government and economy, creating an
    atmosphere of fear and dissatisfaction among the people, increasing
    unrest, and decreasing trust, all in the service of making it easier for
    a military attack on Iran. Of course, so far, they have only strengthened the
    Iranian people’s resolve to protect their country against Imperialism.

    Such actions were carried out against the government of Iraq in
    preparation for a military attack and occupation.

    Saddam Hussein came to power through
    a coup and assassination of the previous ruler.  Hussein
    attacked Iran, used chemical weapons against the Iranian soldiers and
    the Kurdish people, and attacked Kuwait.
    Although Saddam Hussein did all these things, the US was not justified
    in attacking Iraq, and the political forces who were in favor of the
    attack had to tell lies to convince the American people to support it.
    An attack on Iran would be even more heinous because beyond the general
    indefensibility of international interference, the government of Iran
    has not attacked another country or used chemical weapons and it came
    to power through a nonviolent peoples' revolution.

    So, the similarity is in the US actions aimed towards any government
    that fails to submit to the Washington consensus. This disobedience
    or defiance on the part of Iran is its “crime”.

    It is extremely important that all international and especially
    American antiwar and progressive organizations condemn these acts
    of assassination of innocent citizens and all forms of violent and
    aggressive actions by the US, Israel, and the Iranian opposition.
