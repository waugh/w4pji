<h2>
  Video: Interview with Simin Royanian on the 2009 Presidential
  Election in Iran, Part One</h2>
<p>(of four parts)</p>
<p>
  Q: Who is your candidate of choice in the 2009 Iran elections
  and why?</p>
<p>
  Q: Some argue that Ahmadinejad's speeches are harsh against
  the west and that causes tension; do you agree?</p>
<p>
  Q: If Iran is in such a good position domestically,
  then why are people protesting against Ahmadinejad?</p>
<p>
  Q: So are you suggesting that young Iranians are actually
  protesting against the core values of the Islamic
  Republic instead?</p>
