  Video: Interview with Simin Royanian on the 2009 Presidential
  Election in Iran, Part Two</h2>
<p>
  Q: So, if young Iranians want change, do you see these
  protests as a means for them to get those changes,
  or not?
<br/>
  A: I believe that this may not serve their interest
  . . .</p>
<p>
  Q: Don't you think that the Islamic Republic has made it so
  difficult for Iranians to be able to get change the legal
  way that protesting is the only answer?</p>
<p>
  Q: What do you think the western powers want?</p>
<p>
  Q: What do you think the US is doing to flame the fires
  in [the] Iran protest, if they are doing anything at
  all?</p>
