  Video: Interview with Simin Royanian on the 2009 Presidential
  Election in Iran, Part Three</h2>
<p>
  Q: Some may argue that the privitization of Iran
  [<i>sic</i>] may be to its benefit, instead of
  the way it is now.</p>
<p>
  Q: Are you suggesting that Iranians in Iran should stop
  protesting?</p>
<p>
  Q: [It's] not fair to compare [the] US [to] Iran, since it is
  much easier to get a permit in the US for protest than
  it is in Iran.</p>
<p>
  Q: [Whom] does Ahmadinejad represent and [whom] does
  Mousavi represent?</p>
